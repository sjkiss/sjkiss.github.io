    "text": "LISPOP commissioned a survey of voters during the 2022 election and we’ll be disseminating findings from it over the next few weeks. But as an opening, I wanted to take a look at public spending priorities in the 2022 eleciton compared to the 2018 election. To do so, I compared the spending priorities from LISPOP’s 2018 Ontario Provincial Election Survey with those from the 2022 survey. Respondents were ppresented with a series of issue areas and asked to state whether they preferred spending more, the same or less on that area. Although different areas were presented in the two different elections, which are excluded here, there was some overlap. And these are graphed here:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree things jump out at me:\nFirst, the largest movement came in the area of affordable housing. In 2022, 58% of people wanted more spending, commpared to only 47% in 2018, notably crossing the threshold of 50%. The next largest jump was in support for more spending on health care. There isn’t really a surprise here; health care is routinely popular as a target for more spending and we just went through a massive health care crisis.\nAlso notable, in my eyes was the increased support for spending on crime. Here we have to be a little careful. In 2018, respondents were asked to express their spending preferences on “crime and justice” and in 2022 it was “fighting crime.”. So, it’s possible the increased level of support is down to wording changes. But note that the increase came after significant protests in teh United States and in Canada against police brutality and trying to reduce funding for police. It’s possible the public moved the other way.\nLastly, notice that there was a slightly increasdd level of support for increasd spending on the environment.\nWe’ll have more to say on this in the coming months."

    "text": "My dissertation examined the evolution of government public relations in the province of Alberta. The major results of that dissertation have been published in Canadian Public Administration. Fundamentally, I showed that the structure of the government of Alberta’s bureaucratic public relations function was intimately related to both the political economy of the province but also the way the government of the day envisioned the democratic process. Most political and scholarly commentary on this issue argued that the government of Premier Ralph Klein (1992-2007) government substantially expanded its efforts in public relations and that this was a major factor in winning public support for heavy budget cuts and privatization between 1993 and 1997. In actuality, I was able to show that the government of Alberta dramatically reduced (see below). support for communications activities. However, it changed the focus of the government’s PR unit to be much more politically sensitive and playing a role shuttling between the political leadership and public opinion (see below). .\nMore recently, I have been involved in a project with a colleague at the University of Toronto where we surveyed Canadian parliamentarians, journalists and bloggers about their definitions of open government. We hypothesized that different actors would prefer definitions that fit with their interests. This is evident in this key plot of our data and was borne out in formal statistical models (see below)."

We’re investigating the way in which changes in the electoral and financing rules for political parties contributed to a “new” New Democratic Party. This builds on earlier research I’ve conducted examining the politics of the New Politics Initiative in the NDP in 1999-2000.\nI also have a strong interest in the way that social class affects public opinion in the post-industrial societies. I am interested in the interplay of income, status, levels of education and field of study to create political preferences for and against redistribution and environmental protection. I woud like to know if the increasing role played by educated professionals will weaken social democratic parties’ capacity to push for redistribution."

    "text": "Although I am a qualitative researcher at heart, I’m also a keen user of the statistical software R for my quantitative research projects. To my mind, R offers a number of advantages. It is free, it produces beautiful and informative plots, it encourages analytical thinking and familiarization with statistical concepts. It is also becoming extremely popular and it has a vibrant community of software developers and users that can provide assistance and develop new tools to deal with tasks as they emerge.\nI attended the Oxford Spring School in Modern Regression in 2010 that was taught by Dr. Robert Andersen and Dr. David Armstrong. Since then, all of my R learning has been self-taught. To date I have used R to conduct sentiment analysis, event history analysis, as well as standard OLS and logistic regression. I have taught three successive introductory courses in R at the Laurier School In Research Methods.\nOne marginally useful innovation I have developed for R is a plugin to the tm (“text mining”) package that reads in files containing news articles from Canadian media outlets in the Canadian Newsstream database. It extracts all of the useful metadata contained in each article (e.g. author, title, date of publication and word length, as well as section and page number) and prepares the article text for computer assisted content analysis. I have intentions of preparing the package for submission to CRAN, but for the moment, you can get a working version from my github."

    "text": "The bulk of my research since arriving at Wilfrid Laurier University has been to investigate the politics of risk perception, particularly in regards to environmental issues. I have completed a project on the politics of the controversial chemical BPA. In one paper, I was able to show that the level of news coverage in state’s daily newspaper about BPA was correlated with the probability that that state would adopt a ban on BPA. In short, politicians adopt policies responding to media pressure. In a second, more qualitative paper, I examined the interaction between legislative provisions, short term interest-group pressure and media attention that led to Canada being the first country in the world to prohibit baby bottles made with BPA.\nIn the course of this project I was inspired by the work emerging on the cultural cognition of risk perception and the cultural theory of risk. I was awarded a SSHRC Insight Development Grant in 2013 to develop survey measures of the core concepts of cultural theory for the canadian context. Working with Dr. Eric Montpetit and Dr. Erick Lachapelle, I conducted intense qualitative research and survey development to produce these measures. Our first publicadtion from this project can be seen here.\nBuilding on this project, I have been invited to take part in the @risk research project, a SSHRC-funded research project that seeks to find ways to mange the democratic and technocratic tensions managing risks in contemporary Canada."

    "text": "Alex Usher has a series of recent blog posts here, here, here and here looking at academic versus non-academic expendituers and hiring in Canadian universities.\nThe basic thrust of Alex’s findings are that while the numbers of non-academic staff are increasing, their overall aggregate salaries are not. His conclusion is that academic salaries continue to rise partially because there is no churn in the academic job market as there is in non-academic jobs. Once you’re a prof, you’re a prof for a long time and your salary basically increases. In increases at faster rates when you are younger to be sure, but it basically increases the entire time.\nI wanted to play with the data from the Ontario public sector salary disclosure list (‘’Sunshine List’’) to see if we could learn anything about it."

Drawing on novel survey items from the Canadian Election Study, we investigate how economic insecurity, mediated by immigration and feminist attitudes, affects voting behavior. While economic distress has been linked to far-right voting in Europe, we find support that subjective measures of economic distress are significantly associated with voting for the Right in Canada, when interacting with immigration and feminist attitudes. However, the association only holds for men. The findings suggest that Canada, despite its comparatively weak nativist cleavage, is not immune to tensions arising from globalization and economic insecurity.\n\n\n\nPDF"

    "text": "The recent success of far-right populism has led to a wave of public attention to its causes. Drawing on novel survey items from the Canadian Election Study, we investigate how economic insecurity, mediated by immigration and feminist attitudes, affects voting behavior. While economic distress has been linked to far-right voting in Europe, we find support that subjective measures of economic distress are significantly associated with voting for the Right in Canada, when interacting with immigration and feminist attitudes. However, the association only holds for men. The findings suggest that Canada, despite its comparatively weak nativist cleavage, is not immune to tensions arising from globalization and economic insecurity.\n\n\n\nPDF"
