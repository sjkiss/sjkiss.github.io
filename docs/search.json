    "text": "LISPOP commissioned a survey of voters during the 2022 election and we’ll be disseminating findings from it over the next few weeks. But as an opening, I wanted to take a look at public spending priorities in the 2022 eleciton compared to the 2018 election. To do so, I compared the spending priorities from LISPOP’s 2018 Ontario Provincial Election Survey with those from the 2022 survey. Respondents were ppresented with a series of issue areas and asked to state whether they preferred spending more, the same or less on that area. Although different areas were presented in the two different elections, which are excluded here, there was some overlap. And these are graphed here:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree things jump out at me:\nFirst, the largest movement came in the area of affordable housing. In 2022, 58% of people wanted more spending, commpared to only 47% in 2018, notably crossing the threshold of 50%. The next largest jump was in support for more spending on health care. There isn’t really a surprise here; health care is routinely popular as a target for more spending and we just went through a massive health care crisis.\nAlso notable, in my eyes was the increased support for spending on crime. Here we have to be a little careful. In 2018, respondents were asked to express their spending preferences on “crime and justice” and in 2022 it was “fighting crime.”. So, it’s possible the increased level of support is down to wording changes. But note that the increase came after significant protests in teh United States and in Canada against police brutality and trying to reduce funding for police. It’s possible the public moved the other way.\nLastly, notice that there was a slightly increasdd level of support for increasd spending on the environment.\nWe’ll have more to say on this in the coming months."

    "text": "My dissertation examined the evolution of government public relations in the province of Alberta. The major results of that dissertation have been published in Canadian Public Administration. Fundamentally, I showed that the structure of the government of Alberta’s bureaucratic public relations function was intimately related to both the political economy of the province but also the way the government of the day envisioned the democratic process. Most political and scholarly commentary on this issue argued that the government of Premier Ralph Klein (1992-2007) government substantially expanded its efforts in public relations and that this was a major factor in winning public support for heavy budget cuts and privatization between 1993 and 1997. In actuality, I was able to show that the government of Alberta dramatically reduced (see below). support for communications activities. However, it changed the focus of the government’s PR unit to be much more politically sensitive and playing a role shuttling between the political leadership and public opinion (see below). .\nMore recently, I have been involved in a project with a colleague at the University of Toronto where we surveyed Canadian parliamentarians, journalists and bloggers about their definitions of open government. We hypothesized that different actors would prefer definitions that fit with their interests. This is evident in this key plot of our data and was borne out in formal statistical models (see below)."

It is free, it produces beautiful and informative plots, it encourages analytical thinking and familiarization with statistical concepts. It is also becoming extremely popular and it has a vibrant community of software developers and users that can provide assistance and develop new tools to deal with tasks as they emerge.\nI attended the Oxford Spring School in Modern Regression in 2010 that was taught by Dr. Robert Andersen and Dr. David Armstrong. Since then, all of my R learning has been self-taught. To date I have used R to conduct sentiment analysis, event history analysis, as well as standard OLS and logistic regression. I have taught three successive introductory courses in R at the Laurier School In Research Methods.\nOne marginally useful innovation I have developed for R is a plugin to the tm (“text mining”) package that reads in files containing news articles from Canadian media outlets in the Canadian Newsstream database. It extracts all of the useful metadata contained in each article (e.g. author, title, date of publication and word length, as well as section and page number) and prepares the article text for computer assisted content analysis. I have intentions of preparing the package for submission to CRAN, but for the moment, you can get a working version from my github."

    "text": "The bulk of my research since arriving at Wilfrid Laurier University has been to investigate the politics of risk perception, particularly in regards to environmental issues. I have completed a project on the politics of the controversial chemical BPA. In one paper, I was able to show that the level of news coverage in state’s daily newspaper about BPA was correlated with the probability that that state would adopt a ban on BPA. In short, politicians adopt policies responding to media pressure. In a second, more qualitative paper, I examined the interaction between legislative provisions, short term interest-group pressure and media attention that led to Canada being the first country in the world to prohibit baby bottles made with BPA.\nIn the course of this project I was inspired by the work emerging on the cultural cognition of risk perception and the cultural theory of risk. I was awarded a SSHRC Insight Development Grant in 2013 to develop survey measures of the core concepts of cultural theory for the canadian context. Working with Dr. Eric Montpetit and Dr. Erick Lachapelle, I conducted intense qualitative research and survey development to produce these measures. Our first publicadtion from this project can be seen here.\nBuilding on this project, I have been invited to take part in the @risk research project, a SSHRC-funded research project that seeks to find ways to mange the democratic and technocratic tensions managing risks in contemporary Canada."

His conclusion is that academic salaries continue to rise partially because there is no churn in the academic job market as there is in non-academic jobs. Once you’re a prof, you’re a prof for a long time and your salary basically increases. In increases at faster rates when you are younger to be sure, but it basically increases the entire time.\nI wanted to play with the data from the Ontario public sector salary disclosure list (‘’Sunshine List’’) to see if we could learn anything about it."

In contrast to most advanced democracies, class and sectoral voting has largely been neglected in Canada. The ideological and voting preferences of the public sector has been unexamined since the 1980s. Using the Canadian Election Study (1968–2019), we revisit and expand on this literature. We find that the public sector holds more economically leftist attitudes than the public and that a sectoral cleavage has emerged, with public sector employees increasingly supporting the leftist New Democratic Party (NDP). We also find that social class moderates these two relationships, as professionals and managers in the public sector are significantly more likely to vote for the NDP and hold more leftist economic attitudes than their counterparts in both the private sector, and the routine non-manual and working class in the public sector.\n@article{polackorevisiting2025,\n  title = {Revisiting the {{Sectoral Cleavage}} in {{Canada}}: {{Evidence From}} the {{Canadian Election Studies}}},\n  author = {Matthew Polacko and Peter Graefe and Simon Kiss},\n  doi = {10.1111/cars.70014},\n  year = {2025},\n  month = {aug}\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe Education And Income Voting Divides In Canada And Their Consequences For Redistributive Politics\n\n\nSimon Kiss, Peter Graefe & Matt Polacko\n\nElectoral Studies\n\n\nVoting\nsocial democracy\nclass\nCanada\nelections\npublic opinion\n\n\nAbstract\nCitation\nBibTeX\n\n\nCopy\nCopied!\n—\n\n\n\nProfound changes in the nature of class cleavages in advanced capitalist economies have been documented in recent years. Some have posited that the increasingly educated nature of left electorates has weakened impulses for redistribution. In contrast to most advanced democracies, class voting has largely been neglected in Canada, as it has traditionally been viewed as being comparatively weak in the face of strong linguistic, regional, and religious identities. Using the entire series of the Canadian Election Study (1965–2019) we examine the education and income political divides in Canada. We find strong support for a divergence between the effect that income and education have on party voting, as people with high incomes continue to vote for the right, while people with higher levels of education have shifted significantly to the left. However, we also find a strengthening income cleavage, whereby lower-income individuals are increasingly supporting the social democratic New Democratic Party, with redistribution a key driver. The findings reveal that Canada, despite a strengthening class cleavage, largely fits the mould of a multi-elite party system. However, it does so in a distinct fashion from the party systems previously examined in the cleavage literature.\n@article{kisseducation2023,\n  title = {The {{Education And Income Voting Divides In Canada And Their Consequences For Redistributive Politics}}},\n  author = {Simon Kiss and Peter Graefe and Matt Polacko},\n  volume = {85},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.electstud.2023.102648},\n  year = {2023},\n  month = {oct}\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe Changing Nature of Class Voting in Canada, 1965–2019\n\n\nMatthew Polacko, Simon Kiss & Peter Graefe\n\nCanadian Journal of Political Science/Revue canadienne de science politique\n\n\nAbstract\nCitation\nBibTeX\n\n\nCopy\nCopied!\n—\n\n\n\nMuch attention has been paid to the changing class cleavage that structured political conflict in the twentieth century. In contrast to most advanced democracies, class voting has traditionally been weak in Canada. Using the entire series of the Canadian Election Study (1965–2019), we find the historic pattern of working-class voting for the New Democratic Party (NDP) held outside of Quebec in recent elections, before suddenly falling off in 2019. Starting in 2004, we find a clear and distinct trend where the working class has increased its support for the Conservatives. Although greater partisan sorting is occurring over the economy, cultural issues such as moral traditionalism and anti-immigration are now significant drivers of working-class Conservative support. The findings carry important implications for class-party relationships and reveal that Canada, despite its comparatively weak nativist cleavage, is not immune from the tensions social democratic parties have recently experienced in maintaining cross-class coalitions amid socio-economic structural changes. , Résumé On a accordé beaucoup d'attention à l'évolution du clivage de classe qui a structuré les conflits politiques au cours du vingtième siècle. Contrairement à la plupart des démocraties avancées, le vote de classe a traditionnellement été faible au Canada. En utilisant la série complète de l'Étude sur l'élection canadienne (1965-2019), nous trouvons le modèle historique du vote de la classe ouvrière pour le NPD, qui s'est maintenu en dehors du Québec lors des dernières élections, avant de chuter soudainement en 2019. À partir de 2004, nous trouvons une tendance claire et distincte dans laquelle la classe ouvrière a augmenté son soutien aux conservateurs. Bien qu'un plus grand tri partisan se produise sur l'économie, les questions culturelles telles que le traditionalisme moral et l'anti-immigration sont maintenant des moteurs importants du soutien de la classe ouvrière au Parti conservateur. Les résultats ont des implications importantes pour les relations entre les classes et les partis et révèlent que le Canada, malgré son clivage nativiste relativement faible, n'est pas à l'abri des tensions que les partis sociaux-démocrates ont récemment connues pour maintenir des coalitions interclasses dans un contexte de changements structurels socio-économiques.\n@article{polackochanging2022,\n  title = {The {{Changing Nature}} of {{Class Voting}} in {{Canada}}, 1965–2019},\n  author = {Matthew Polacko and Simon Kiss and Peter Graefe},\n  volume = {55},\n  number = {3},\n  pages = {663--686},\n  doi = {10.1017/S0008423922000439},\n  url = {https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/canadian-journal-of-political-science-revue-canadienne-de-science-politique/article/changing-nature-of-class-voting-in-canada-19652019/FA5E431D849C30B9E531EC046A6107B6},\n  year = {2022},\n  month = {sep},\n  note = {Last visited on 02/25/2025}\n}\n\n\n\n\nBeyond Region and Ideology: Cultural Theory and Risk Perception in Canada\n\n\nSimon Kiss, Erick Lachapelle & Eric Montpetit\n\nCanadian Journal of Political Science / Revue canadienne de science politique\n\n\nRisk perception\nCanada\npublic opinion\n\n\nAbstract\nCitation\nBibTeX\n\n\nCopy\nCopied!\n—\n\n\n\nCultural theory (CT) has been widely used to explain variations in risk perception but has rarely been tested in Canada. This contribution represents the most thorough attempt to adapt CT to the Canadian context. Study results suggest that respondents’ commitment to egalitarianism was strongly correlated with risks from technology, while respondents’ commitment to hierarchism was strongly correlated with risks from criminal or unsafe behaviours. Respondents’ commitment to individualism was also correlated with risks from criminal and unsafe behaviours but differed from hierarchism in that individualism was not correlated with risk perceptions from prostitution and marijuana use. Respondents’ commitments to fatalism were strongly correlated with risk perception of vaccines. These conclusions are reinforced by results from a survey question that tests the extent to which such cultural predispositions map onto the myths of nature hypothesized by CT and by a survey experiment that tests how cultural commitments predict perceived risks from a controversial pipeline.\n@article{kissregion2020,\n  title = {Beyond {{Region}} and {{Ideology}}: {{Cultural Theory}} and {{Risk Perception}} in {{Canada}}},\n  author = {Simon Kiss and Erick Lachapelle and Eric Montpetit},\n  volume = {53},\n  number = {2},\n  doi = {doi:10.1017/S0008423920000177},\n  year = {2020},\n  month = {apr}\n}\n\n\n\n\nConservative Populism, or Unpopular Liberalism?

Overall, respondents preferred to define open government in terms of access to information and sources. However, controlling for age, ideology and language, we also found that respondents in the different positions ranked definitions of open government differently. Journalists are more likely than any other group to define open government in terms of access to information and sources. In contrast, parliamentarians who were members of a governing party were as likely to choose definitions of open government that emphasized public participation as they were to choose definitions that emphasized access to information. Opposition parliamentarians share more similarities with government parliamentarians than with journalists. These results suggest that key actors in the Canadian policy landscape define open government in ways that are consistent with their institutional interests. We suggest that these results reflect ways in which open government operates more like a buzzword, which helps explain the common pattern whereby opposition parties make promises to be more open and, after taking power, operate in less open ways. Moreover, these results raise questions about the extent to which open government can actually operate as an organizing principle.\n@article{woottenambiguous2019,\n  title = {The {{Ambiguous Definition}} of {{Open Government}}: {{Parliamentarians}}, {{Journalists}} and {{Bloggers Define Open Government In Accordance With Their Interests}}},\n  author = {George W.

Drawing on novel survey items from the Canadian Election Study, we investigate how economic insecurity, mediated by immigration and feminist attitudes, affects voting behavior. While economic distress has been linked to far-right voting in Europe, we find support that subjective measures of economic distress are significantly associated with voting for the Right in Canada, when interacting with immigration and feminist attitudes. However, the association only holds for men. The findings suggest that Canada, despite its comparatively weak nativist cleavage, is not immune to tensions arising from globalization and economic insecurity.\n\n\n\nPDF"
