  abstract = {In this article, we revisit the main claims of Part Four of Thomas Piketty's Capital and Ideology and especially the changing support coalitions for parties of the left. Piketty's core argument in this part of the book is that the left now represents the highly educated and that, as a result, the redistributive preferences of the working class do not find representation in today's party systems. We address these claims building on existing political science research that has investigated the transformation of politics in advanced capitalist societies. We argue, first, that the educational divide cannot be adequately analyzed by looking at a left and a right bloc, but crucially needs to pay attention to the rise of green/left-libertarian and radical right parties. Second, we contend that the new middle classes that support parties of the left are largely in favor of economic redistribution. Analyzing data from the European Social Survey in 11 West European countries from 2002 to 2018, we show that the effect of education on voting left or right is indeed largely driven by green/left-libertarian and radical right parties, while there is little empirical evidence that social democratic parties represent the educational elite. We also find that redistributive preferences remain at the heart of voting behavior and that, especially for educated voters, these preferences determine whether someone votes for a party of the left rather than the right.},

The authors contribute to recent advances in the literature that have highlighted the role of economic threat for understanding the support of radical-right parties. In contrast to existing work, the authors do not treat voters as atomistic individuals; they instead investigate households as a crucial site of preference formation. Combining largescale labor market data with comparative survey data, they confirm the expectations of their theoretical framework by demonstrating that the effect of occupational unemployment risk on radical-right support is strongly conditioned by household-risk constellations. Voting for the radical right is a function not only of a voter's own risk, but also of his or her partner's risk. The article provides additional evidence on the extent to which these effects are gendered and on the mechanisms that link household risk and party choice. The results imply that much of the existing literature on individual risk exposure potentially underestimates its effect on political behavior due to the neglect of multiplier effects within households.},

One popular argument is that Social Democratic decline is the result of these parties' liberal cultural positions and pro-EU stance, with both topics increasingly salient for their traditional voters, particularly among the working class. However, we lack comparative evidence testing this argument. In this paper, we combine CHES data on party positions with ESS survey data to analyze the electoral effects of Social Democratic parties' second dimension and EU positions. In addition, we focus on whether support from different socio-economic groups is sensitive to these positions. In contrast to much public debate, we find that more authoritarian/nationalist and more anti-EU positions are if anything associated with lower rather than greater electoral support for social democratic parties.},

These failings, in the authors' view, mean that voters are incapable of holding politicians to account. But Achen and Bartels overstate voters' failure to engage in effective retrospective voting. The authors also understate the degree to which accountability can be compatible with voters' being myopic, such as when early- and late-term performance are correlated. Achen and Bartels also overlook evidence that the American state acted as an insurer against social risk long before the New Deal, a fact that points to voters using relevant criteria (not irrelevant ones) when they appear to punish incumbents for natural disasters. Finally, while accountability is an important consequentialist reason for democracy, we should keep in mind non-consequentialist justifications for this system of government, in particular its instantiation of political equality.},

  abstract = {Why our belief in government by the people is unrealistic---and what we can do about itDemocracy for Realists assails the romantic folk-theory at the heart of contemporary thinking about democratic politics and government, and offers a provocative alternative view grounded in the actual human nature of democratic citizens.Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels deploy a wealth of social-scientific evidence, including ingenious original analyses of topics ranging from abortion politics and budget deficits to the Great Depression and shark attacks, to show that the familiar ideal of thoughtful citizens steering the ship of state from the voting booth is fundamentally misguided. They demonstrate that voters---even those who are well informed and politically engaged---mostly choose parties and candidates on the basis of social identities and partisan loyalties, not political issues. They also show that voters adjust their policy views and even their perceptions of basic matters of fact to match those loyalties. When parties are roughly evenly matched, elections often turn on irrelevant or misleading considerations such as economic spurts or downturns beyond the incumbents' control; the outcomes are essentially random. Thus, voters do not control the course of public policy, even indirectly.Achen and Bartels argue that democratic theory needs to be founded on identity groups and political parties, not on the preferences of individual voters. Now with new analysis of the 2016 elections, Democracy for Realists provides a powerful challenge to conventional thinking, pointing the way toward a fundamentally different understanding of the realities and potential of democratic government.},

  abstract = {Following up on suggestions that attitudes toward science are multi-dimensional, we analyze nationally representative survey data collected in the United States in 2014 (N\,=\,2006), and demonstrate the existence of a science confidence gap: some people place great trust in scientific methods and principles, but simultaneously distrust scientific institutions. This science confidence gap is strongly associated with level of education: it is larger among the less educated than among the more educated. We investigate explanations for these educational differences. Whereas hypotheses deduced from reflexive-modernization theory do not pass the test, those derived from theorizing on the role of anomie are corroborated. The less educated are more anomic (they have more modernity-induced cultural discontents), which not only underlies their distrust in scientific institutions, but also fuels their trust in scientific methods and principles. This explains why this science confidence gap is most pronounced among the less educated.},

Some of these problems arise from generalizations made from very partial views of only certain movements.

Would such policy responsiveness enhance these parties' electoral support? We report the results of statistical analyses of the relationship between parties' policy positions, voters' policy preferences, and election outcomes in eight Western European democracies from 1976 to 1998 that suggest that the answer to both questions is no. Specifically, we find no evidence that niche parties responded to shifts in public opinion, while mainstream parties displayed consistent tendencies to respond to public opinion shifts. Furthermore, we find that in situations where niche parties moderated their policy positions they were systematically punished at the polls (a result consistent with the hypothesis that such parties represent extreme or noncentrist ideological clienteles), while mainstream parties did not pay similar electoral penalties. Our findings have important implications for political representation, for spatial models of elections, and for political parties' election strategies.}

Optimal (Nash equilibrium) strategies are determined for alternative models for presidential elections in the US and France, and for parliamentary elections in Britain and Norway. These polities cover a wide range of electoral rules, number of major parties, and governmental structures. The analyses suggest that the more competitive parties generally take policy positions that come close to maximizing their electoral support, and that these vote-maximizing positions correlate strongly with the mean policy positions of their supporters.},

A GIO contributes to public understanding of government policies and raises awareness of the roles of decision makers and purview of state institutions, the availability of social services, noteworthy trends, and risks to public health and safety. In Central and Eastern Europe, a GIO's responsibilities typically include: monitoring media coverage of public affairs; briefing and advising political officials; managing media relations; providing information directly to the public; sharing information across the administration; formulating communication strategies and campaigns; and researching and assessing public opinion. Because of the region's communist heritage, GIOs in Central and Eastern Europe confront a number of special challenges, starting with poorly performing public administrations. Other problems include immature media, secrecy and political influence, and a lack of training and skills. However, as democratic, market, and media practices in Central and Eastern Europe come to resemble those in Western Europe, the activities and attitudes of GIOs in the former region are becoming more like their counterparts in the latter.},

Although campaign research is flourishing, it is unclear to what extent U.S. and European media cover campaigns differently. Therefore, this study analyzes how the U.S. press covered both the 2008 and 2016 campaigns in comparison with the press in 6 West European countries. We analyze 2 central characteristics of campaign coverage: (1) the tone or degree of negativity and (2) the substantial nature of the coverage. Our results confirm that substantial issue coverage is low, and a negative view of candidates and the campaign is prevailing. Although there is variation in the coverage within and between the countries under study, structural differences between the press in the U.S. and Europe are almost absent. In line with the idea of media convergence, this suggests that we can no longer distinguish the campaign coverage of U.S. and European newspapers. We argue that shared news values and the specific context of campaigns determine news coverage across the board.},

Christo Aivalis argues that although Trudeau found key influences and friendships on the left, he was in fact a consistently classic liberal, driven by individualist and capitalist principles. While numerous biographies have noted the impact of the left on Trudeau's intellectual and political development, this comprehensive analysis showcases the interplay between liberalism and democratic socialism that defined his world view -- and shaped his effective use of power. The Constant Liberal suggests that Trudeau's leftist activity was not so much a call for social democracy as a warning to fellow liberals that lack of reform could undermine liberal-capitalist social relations.},

  abstract = {The sudden and perhaps unexpected appearance of populist parties in the 1990s shows no sign of immediately vanishing. The lion's share of the research on populism has focused on defining populism, on the causes for its rise and continued success, and more recently on its influence on government and on public policy. Less research has, however, been conducted on measuring populist attitudes among voters. In this article, we seek to fill this gap by measuring populist attitudes and to investigate whether these attitudes can be linked with party preferences. We distinguish three political attitudes: (1) populist attitudes, (2) pluralist attitudes, and (3) elitist attitudes. We devise a measurement of these attitudes and explore their validity by way of using a principal component analysis on a representative Dutch data set (N = 600). We indeed find three statistically separate scales of political attitudes. We further validated the scales by testing whether they are linked to party preferences and find that voters who score high on the populist scale have a significantly higher preference for the Dutch populist parties, the Party for Freedom, and the Socialist Party.},

When researchers have needed to code more texts than is feasible or cost-effective, they have turned to machine learn- ing methods. In contrast, we propose an automated dictionary-based content anal- ysis approach for replicating the policy agendas codes for English and Dutch texts. We validate the dictionaries several ways. For the English-language dictionary, we use data from Prime Minister's Question Time (from the United Kingdom) dataset and the State of the Union speeches (from the United States), both human-coded for each country's respective codebooks. For the Dutch-language dictionary, we compare the results to media content and party manifestos from Belgium previously coded using the Policy Agendas codes. Results suggest that these two dictionaries may produce valid, reliable and comparable measures of policy agendas, and that may be is possible to create similar dictionaries for other languages.},

The results indicate that genetics plays an important role in shaping political attitudes and ideologies but a more modest role in forming party identification; as such, they call for finer distinctions in theorizing about the sources of political attitudes. We conclude by urging political scientists to incorporate genetic influences, specifically interactions between genetic heritability and social environment, into models of political attitude formation.},

Addressing the first claim, we present analysis from a new data set on unemployment insurance and sickness benefit replacement rates for 18 countries for the years 1975-99. We find considerably more evidence of welfare retrenchment during the last two decades than do recent cross-national studies. Second, we examine the "end of partisanship" claim by estimating the effects of government partisanship on changes in income replacement rates in sickness and unemployment programs. Our results suggest that, contrary to claims that partisanship has little impact on welfare state commitments, traditional partisanship continues to have a considerable effect on welfare state entitlements in the era of retrenchment.},

User interactions with false content rose steadily on both Facebook and Twitter through the end of 2016.

The models can be easily estimated with programs for proportional hazards models, and they can be generalized to allow for ties in the rankings. Detailed examples are given.},

Within the last two years, the raven-haired, sharp-featured journalist has risen from legislature bureau chief of the Edmonton Journal to editorial page editor of the Herald to managing editor. Her telegenic face now appears routinely on national CBC-TV Sunday newscasts, matching wit and wisdom with star telepundits like Globe and Mail columnist Jeffrey Simpson. Clearly she takes her newfound power and influence seriously. So seriously, in fact, that she believes the Southam newspaper chain she works for should dedicate itself preserving nation al unity. And to that end, at a Calgary national unity conference attended by Quebec Liberal leader Daniel Johnson two weeks ago, she outlined a seven-point plan for the Southam empire to help save Canada from break-up.},

Although it is often presumed that citizens' policy preferences are the opinions of interest to democratic theorists, and that democracy requires a highly informed citizenry, neither of these premises represents a dominant position in mainstream democratic theory. Besides incorrect assumptions about major tenets of democratic theory, empirical research on civic engagement is running into dead ends that will require normative analysis to overcome. Bringing political philosophy back in to the study of public opinion can not only remedy shortcomings in the empirical literature, but can also underscore how relevant that literature is for a wide range of problems in democratic practice.},

  abstract = {In a recent paper, Piketty argues that the vote for the left in France, the UK and the USA tends increasingly to be associated with a high education level whereas a traditional class- or income-based divide separated left from right individuals in the 1950s and 1960s. The current situation would be characterised by a dominance of `elites' in left and right constituencies: financially rich elites vote for the right (merchant right), high-education elites vote for the left (brahmin left). Using ISSP data for 17 countries, this paper tests the influence of income and education inequalities on political leaning and a variety of policy preferences: the support for redistribution, for investment in public education, for globalisation and immigration. Results show that income levels are still relevant for the left-right divide, but the influence differs across education levels. Our findings also point to a certain convergence of opinion among the Brahmin left and the merchant right, which could lead to a new political divide beyond the left and the right, uniting a bloc bourgeois.},

We apply this integrated theory to the major regions of the USA, Canada and Great Britain. We find striking national and regional similarities in the effects of social  group memberships on attitudes, but considerable diversity in the effects of social group membership on vote. Race is a notable exception---it deviates in the absence of uniformity of its effects of the cleavage on both attitudes and vote.  That we find significant regional differences within countries suggests the importance of using region, rather than country, as the unit of analysis. These findings also underline the importance of paying close attention to political context when assessing the effects of social groups on voting.}

This study, in taking as its focus the operation of  specific news frames, identifies a range of factors that shaped the  initial terms of the subsequent debate (between both advocates and  critics of nanotechnology)from one newspaper to the next during this  period The analysis suggests that the involvement of a celebrity may  play a crucial role in enhancing the newsworthiness of an issue and  influencing its subsequent framing in the newspaper press.},

  abstract = {Abstract.               Concern about the environment has grown around the world. Important work has assessed the correlates of support for the environment and its relationship to values (for example, Inglehart, 1995). Recent comparative work on political party positioning demonstrates how the issue has increasingly taken on a left--right dimension (Dalton, 2009). Filling a void in the literature, this paper explores how and whether the environmental issue has been incorporated into the ideological space of Canadian citizens and reflected in the views of the major political parties outside of Quebec. In particular, we first consider the extent to which the environment is a left--right issue in the minds of Canadian citizens. We follow this by assessing the effect of environmental concern on citizens' views of political parties and whether this issue tends to operate as a positional or valence issue in differentiating political parties. We use the Canadian Election Studies from 2000--2006 to address these research questions empirically.                                         R{\'e}sum{\'e}.               L'int{\'e}r{\^e}t pour la protection de l'environnement s'est intensifi{\'e} autour du monde. Des recherches ont {\'e}t{\'e} men{\'e}es sur la corr{\'e}lation entre l'id{\'e}ologie et la protection de l'environnement (par exemple, Inglehart 1995). Une {\'e}tude r{\'e}cente sur le positionnement des partis politiques en mati{\`e}re d'environnement d{\'e}montre que la question prend de plus en plus une dimension gauche--droite (Dalton 2009). Dans le but de combler un manque dans la litt{\'e}rature, cet article tente d'{\'e}tablir dans quelle mesure l'environnement a effectivement {\'e}t{\'e} int{\'e}gr{\'e} dans l'espace id{\'e}ologique des citoyens canadiens et se refl{\`e}te dans l'opinion sur les principaux partis politiques {\`a} l'ext{\'e}rieur du Qu{\'e}bec. Nous examinons d'abord jusqu'{\`a} quel point l'environnement est consid{\'e}r{\'e} par les Canadiens comme un enjeu politique de gauche ou de droite. Nous {\'e}valuons ensuite l'effet de cet int{\'e}r{\^e}t pour l'environnement sur l'opinion des citoyens canadiens {\`a} l'{\'e}gard des partis politiques en vue de d{\'e}terminer s'il s'agit l{\`a} d'un enjeu de valeur ou d'un enjeu positionnel dans les choix politiques et {\'e}lectoraux. Nous appuyons empiriquement notre {\'e}tude sur les donn{\'e}es de l'{\'E}tude {\'e}lectorale canadienne de 2000 {\`a} 2006.},

Since then it has sold over a quarter of a million copies and is widely considered the most important book on the subject. In this greatly anticipated revised edition, Anderson updates and elaborates on the core question: what makes people live and die for nations, as well as hate and kill in their name? Anderson examines the creation and global spread of the `imagined communities' of nationality, and explores the processes that created these communities: the territorialization of religious faiths, the decline of antique kinship, the interaction between capitalism and print, the development of secular languages-of-state, and changing conceptions of time and space. He shows how an originary nationalism born in the Americas was adopted by popular movements in Europe, by imperialist powers, and by the movements of anti-imperialist resistance in Asia and Africa.In a new afterword, Anderson examines the extraordinary influence of Imagined Communities, and the book's international publication and reception, from the end of the Cold War era to the present day.},

Using panel data from Spain, we show that modern sexism is indeed among the most important attitudinal predictors of voting for the far-right party Vox. The results also show that internal individual changes in levels of modern sexism impact far-right voting. Backlash attitudinal change, defined as increases in sexism occurring in a context of feminist momentum, contributed significantly to the recent emergence of the radical right. Our findings indicate that sexism is not a crystalized attitude but rather susceptible to showing short-term changes with important political consequences. This highlights the importance of understudied context-dependent individual dynamics of gender backlash in far-right voting.},

In the modern experimentalist paradigm, these techniques address clear causal questions such as: Do smaller classes increase learning? Should wife batterers be arrested? How much does education raise wages? Mostly Harmless Econometrics shows how the basic tools of applied econometrics allow the data to speak.In addition to econometric essentials, Mostly Harmless Econometrics covers important new extensions---regression-discontinuity designs and quantile regression---as well as how to get standard errors right. Joshua Angrist and J{\"o}rn-Steffen Pischke explain why fancier econometric techniques are typically unnecessary and even dangerous.

We demonstrate that these findings are manifestations of measurement error associated with individual survey items. First, we show that averaging a large number of survey items on the same broadly defined issue area---for example, government involvement in the economy, or moral issues---eliminates a large amount of measurement error and reveals issue preferences that are well structured and stable. This stability increases steadily as the number of survey items increases and can approach that of party identification. Second, we show that once measurement error has been reduced through the use of multiple measures, issue preferences have much greater explanatory power in models of presidential vote choice, again approaching that of party identification.},

  abstract = {Abstract             There is substantial disagreement over the extent to which political parties in Canada can be distinguished on ideological grounds. Research on mass publics has usually concluded that ideology plays only a modest role in structuring orientations towards parties. However, a growing body of survey data on party activists suggests a greater degree of ideological clarity and policy cohesiveness. This note extends earlier research by Blake, Johnston and Perlin on Liberal and Conservative convention delegates and compares them with delegates to the 1987 federal New Democratic party convention. Survey data on convention delegates suggest that political activists array themselves in a relatively consistent manner across a range of issues in ways that are compatible with a left/right ideological typology. Our findings also suggest that New Democrats display the greatest consensus and ideological distinctiveness of the three parties studied.           ,              R{\'e}sum{\'e}             Il existe un profond d{\'e}saccord quant {\`a} savoir jusqu'{\`a} quel point on peut caract{\'e}riser les partis politiques du Canada selon des lignes id{\'e}ologiques. Les travaux de recherche sur les masses ont le plus souvent conclu que l'id{\'e}ologie ne joue qu'un r{\^o}le modeste dans la structuration des orientations vis-{\`a}-vis des partis politiques.

No more than 10\% of delegates picked any one individual as their first choice to replace Broadbent, and less than 20\% agreed on any individual as their combined first or second choices. If nothing else, Broadbent has been very successful in unifying the party behind him. Nonetheless, there were some clear leaders. The strongest support in our poll was for [Bob White], who received a first or second place nod from 17.3\% of delegates. He was followed by Marion Dewar (12.8\%), whose stock has presumably decreased since she lost her seat in the House; Lorne Nystrom (12.6\%); Nelson Riis (11.8\%); Stephen Lewis (11.1\%); Nova Scotia NDP leader Alexa McDonough (10.5\%), who had a disappointing performance in the recent provincial election; Bob Rae (9.2\%); Roy Romanow (7\%); Svend Robinson (5.8\%), before declaring his homosexuality; Dave Barrett (4.8\%), now a high-profile MP; Ed Schreyer (3.3\%); and Pauline Jewett, who has now retired from active politics, (3\%). For delegates to the 1987 NDP convention there was no obvious successor to the still popular Ed Broadbent. Many held allegiance to a candidate from their region. Some of the greatest uncertainty existed within the Ontario delegation, and given its size it is here that the potential leadership contest will be won or lost. At this early juncture no one's lead is insurmountable, and many will listen with great interest when Broadbent steps up to the podium on March 4- 5.},

Jeffrey C. Isaac, The Washington PostHannah Arendt's definitive work on totalitarianism and an essential component of any study of twentieth-century political historyThe Origins of Totalitarianism begins with the rise of anti-Semitism in central and western Europe in the 1800s and continues with an examination of European colonial imperialism from 1884 to the outbreak of World War I. Arendt explores the institutions and operations of totalitarian movements, focusing on the two genuine forms of totalitarian government in our time--Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia--which she adroitly recognizes were two sides of the same coin, rather than opposing philosophies of Right and Left. From this vantage point, she discusses the evolution of classes into masses, the role of propaganda in dealing with the nontotalitarian world, the use of terror, and the nature of isolation and loneliness as preconditions for total domination.},

  abstract = {Against premature claims about the declining political relevance of social class in post-industrial democracies, recent research indicates that class continues to be a relevant determinant of political preferences. In post-industrial societies `old' class divides on economic issues coexist with `new' class alignments on cultural topics. While there is cumulated evidence of social classes' distinct placement on these issues, this paper argues that the strength of class divides depends on the extent to which these issues are politicized by political parties. Studying preferences on economic and cultural issues (attitudes towards redistribution, immigration, gay rights and European integration), this study shows that class divides in preferences are context dependent. The multilevel analyses drawing on data from the European Social Survey and the Chapel Hill Expert Survey for 27 European democracies demonstrate that classes' differences in preferences are accentuated on issues strongly contested and emphasized by parties, and mitigated on issues where party conflict is weaker. Adding to recent literature on parties and class conflict, this study identifies another stage at which parties can affect the strength of class voting. The varying strength of class divides across contexts also has implications for parties' ability to garner support beyond a single class. This becomes increasingly unlikely in contexts of high issue politicization.},

The bio-index method counts the number of variables for which each candidate rates favorably, and the forecast is that the candidate with the highest score would win the popular vote. The bio-index relies on different information and includes more variables than traditional econometric election forecasting models. The method is useful in combination with simple linear regression to estimate a relationship between the index score of the candidate of the incumbent party and his share of the popular vote. The study tests the model for the 29 U.S. presidential elections from 1896 to 2008. The model's forecasts, calculated by cross-validation, correctly predicted the popular vote winner for 27 of the 29 elections; this performance compares favorably to forecasts from polls (15 out of 19), prediction markets (22 out of 26), and three econometric models (12 to 13 out of 15 to 16). Out-of-sample forecasts of the two-party popular vote for the four elections from 1996 to 2008 yielded a forecast error almost as low as the best of seven econometric models. The model can help parties to select the candidates running for office, and help to improve on the accuracy of election forecasting, especially for longer-term forecasts. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

We argue that the urban-rural divide is important for understanding election outcomes during several periods of Canadian political development, and never more so than in recent decades. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for research on urban-rural cleavages, Canadian electoral politics and Canadian political development.},

Out of the 232 claims, we were able to successfully reproduce 163 (70\%), 18 of which only by deviating from the article's analytical description. Thirteen (7\%) of the 185 claims deemed significant by the authors are no longer so.

We then link our findings with other findings of empirical research on this topic, give practical recommendations on how to achieve reproducibility, and discuss the challenges of large-scale reproducibility checks as well as promising ideas that could considerably increase the reproducibility of psychological research.

The eight essays in Aboriginal and Treaty Rights in Canada focus on redressing this bias. All of them apply contemporary knowledge of historical events as well as current legal and cultural theory in an attempt to level the playing field. The book highlights rich historical information that previous scholars may have overlooked. Of particular note are data relevant to better understanding the political and legal relations established by treaty and the Royal Proclamation of 1763. Other essays include discussion of such legal matters as the definition of Aboriginal rights and the privileging of written over oral testimony in litigation.},

  abstract = {The Canadian state presents itself as tolerant, anti-colonial and self-critical. Yet, the legal justification for the Crown's acquisition of sovereignty and jurisdiction concerning Indigenous peoples and their lands, relies on the colonial era doctrine of terra nullius which is based on the proposition that Indigenous peoples were sufficiently inferior to enable the Crown to presume that their territories were unoccupied. This paper discusses how the doctrine of terra nullius becomes applied in Canadian law and its limitations as an acceptable proposition at this time in history. It then discusses and evaluates alternatives to that doctrine which have been proposed in various quarters in order to determine the possibilities for the conceptualization and establishment of a political and legal relationship between First Nations and Canada that is post-colonial in its approach and practice., L'{\'E}tat canadien se pr{\'e}sente comme tol{\'e}rant, anti-colonial et auto-critique. Cependant, la justification l{\'e}gale de la Couronne pour acqu{\'e}rir souverainet{\'e} et juridiction sur les Peuples autochtones et leurs terres s'appuie sur la doctrine coloniale de la terra nullius qui est fond{\'e}e sur le postulat que les peuples indig{\`e}nes {\'e}taient inf{\'e}rieurs au point de permettre {\`a} la Couronne de pr{\'e}sumer que leurs terres {\'e}taient inoccup{\'e}es. L'article analyse comment la doctrine de la terra nullius a fini par s'appliquer en droit canadien et ses limites en tant que proposition acceptable dans la contemporan{\'e}it{\'e}. Dans un second temps, il {\'e}value des alternatives propos{\'e}es dans des milieux vari{\'e}s pour d{\'e}terminer si la conceptualisation et la mise en {\oe}uvre d'une relation politique et l{\'e}gale entre les Premi{\`e}res nations et le Canada qui serait post-coloniale dans sa perspective et pratique, est possible.},

  abstract = {M. Sakaue et al. (2001,J. Occup. Health vol. 43, pp. 185-190) have described how oral exposure of sexually mature male rats to bisphenol A (BPA) between postnatal days (PND) 91-97 led to a reduction in daily sperm production (DSP) 5 weeks later (18 weeks of age). Activity was observed over the dose range 20 microgram/kg-200 mg/kg BPA, with an absence of activity over the dose range 2 ng/kg-2 microgram/kg BPA. There was no evidence of a dose response relationship over the active dose range (five orders of magnitude range). The observation of endocrine disruption (ED) effects for BPA at such low doses, and in sexually mature animals, was unexpected. It was therefore decided to mount an independent repeat of their study. A total of four independent studies were conducted according to the protocol used by Sakaue et al. Doses of 20 microgram/kg, 2 mg/kg, or 200 mg/kg BPA were administered to adult Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats over PND 91-97, and the studies were terminated when the rats reached the age of 18 weeks. Three different rodent diets were employed (RM3, Purina 5002, and CE2), the last of which had been used by Sakaue et al. BPA failed to give any evidence of ED activities, including the changes in DSP reported by Sakaue et al. 2001. During the course of these studies, the test protocol was adapted to coincide more precisely with that used by Sakaue et al.; this included restricting the number of animals per cage, removing bedding from the cages, and changing to the use of glass water bottles in the cages. The only thing of interest to emerge from our studies was the observation of a significant difference in DSP between the control groups of our first and second study. As the change in diet from RM3 to Purina 5002 was the major difference between those two studies, we conducted a repeat of the second study, but we were unable to confirm the differences seen between the first and second study. The probability that those differences arose either by chance, or as the result of intrinsic study-to-study variability, was strengthened by the absence of significant differences in the sperm parameters in a final (fifth) study where the sperm parameters for control animals maintained on the three different diets were compared under the conditions of the main experiments. No explanation for our failure to replicate the effects reported by Sakaue et al. is evident. A review of DSP values reported in the recent literature is provided and discussed, and it is concluded that use of the term DSP/g testis rather than DSP/testis could increase the sensitivity of DSP assessments.},

Nagel et al. (Environ. Health Perspect. 105, 70-76, 1997) reported similar effects in CF1 mice at 6 months of age after exposure in utero to low dose levels (2 and 20 microg/kg/day) of bisphenol A (BPA). vom Saal et al. (Toxicol. Indust. Health 14(1/2) 239-260, 1998) subsequently reported reduced sperm efficiency (daily sperm production per gram testes) in a subset of the BPA animals for which enlarged prostates had been observed. These three experiments have been repeated in a single experiment that was terminated when the offspring reached 6 months of age. No statistically significant effects on prostate weight or sperm efficiency were recorded for offspring of animals exposed to either DES (0.2 microg/kg/day) or BPA (2 and 20 microg/kg/day) in utero. Significant dam effects were seen for several of the assay parameters indicating that the litter, as opposed to the individual, should be considered as the statistical unit in such experiments. A statistically significant increase in body weight was recorded for the low dose BPA male offspring. Females from the study underwent normal sexual maturation and showed no significant differences in reproductive tissue weights at termination and the mean day of vaginal opening. The possible reasons for this failure to confirm the earlier reported effects for DES and BPA at these low doses are discussed.},

It is concluded that our present failure to confirm any such effects is due, in large part, to a general lack of understanding of confounding influences and the failure of most investigators to confirm their findings before publication. The major potential confounding factor is suggested to be variability of the parameters under study within control groups, a factor that assumes increased importance when attempting to demonstrate weak low-dose effects. This is illustrated by our studies with bisphenol A in the mouse uterotrophic assay and of finasteride in the Hershberger antiandrogenicity assay. In both of these cases our ability to demonstrate a low-dose effect is dependent on whether concurrent or recent control values are used.},

  abstract = {The rational choice model of politics, which construes important political processes as a series of choices taken by self-interested political actors, has dominated theorizing on the subject of policy instruments in Canada. While useful, this approach is nonetheless limited by its narrow conception of rationality and its inattention to the context of instrument choice. As an alternative, the neo-institutional approach offers a perspective on political choice that takes better account of contextual and organizational factors. In this article, the logic of both approaches is used to explain the policy process in the case of automobile insurance in Ontario. The purpose of this exercise is exploratory, not confirmatory. Both approaches do, in fact, offer plausible explanations for the creation of a rate review board, the retention of fault-liability as the basis of compensation and the apparent rejection of public automobile insurance. However, the study concludes that it is essential that research strategies in the realm of instrument choice incorporate insights from the neo-institutional approach. /// Le mod{\`e}le du choix rationnel en mati{\`e}re de politiques qui pr{\'e}sente les processus politiques d'importance comme une s{\'e}rie de choix faits par des personnages politiques motiv{\'e}s par l'int{\'e}r{\^e}t personnel, a domin{\'e} le champ th{\'e}orique au sujet des instruments de politiques au Canada.

Le but de ce travail est d'explorer, et non de confirmer. En effet, les deux approches offrent des explications raisonnables en faveur de la cr{\'e}ation d'un conseil de r{\'e}vision des taux d'assurance, pour le maintien de l'imputation de la faute comme base de d{\'e}dommagement, et enfin pour le rejet, de toute apparence, du concept d'assurance-automobile {\'e}tatis{\'e}e.

Out of 670 political broadcasts by Likud and Labour, 207 were examined for five out of the six electoral campaigns that took place since 1988: the 1988 and 1992 campaigns, before the switch to the presidentary system, the 1996 and 1999 campaigns after the establishment of the combined system and the 2003 campaign, after Israel changed back to the parliamentary electoral system. The findings supported the study's main arguments regarding the extent and direction of the impact of the change in the electoral system on the developments in political marketing. Beginning in 1996, there was a decrease in broadcasts presenting political issues and a sharp increase in broadcasts that focus on personality alone. Equivalently, the percentage of broadcasts addressing the centre of the political map, rather than distinct publics, grew significantly. In 2003, with the return to the parliamentary system, the marketing strategy of the two parties, and more particularly of the Labour Party, changed back to the pre-1992 pattern: a large percentage of the broadcasts focused on issues and not on the candidates' personalities, and addressed distinct target audiences rather than the centre.},

We argue that computer capital (1) substitutes for workers in performing cognitive and manual tasks that can be accomplished by following explicit rules; and (2) complements workers in performing nonroutine problem-solving and complex communications tasks. Provided that these tasks are imperfect substitutes, our model implies measurable changes in the composition of job tasks, which we explore using representative data on task input for 1960 to 1998. We find that within industries, occupations, and education groups, computerization is associated with reduced labor input of routine manual and routine cognitive tasks and increased labor input of nonroutine cognitive tasks. Translating task shifts into education demand, the model can explain 60 percent of the estimated relative demand shift favoring college labor during 1970 to 1998. Task changes within nominally identical occupations account for almost half of this impact.},

In The Evolution of Cooperation, political scientist Robert Axelrod seeks to answer this question. In 1980, he organized the famed Computer Prisoners Dilemma Tournament, which sought to find the optimal strategy for survival in a particular game. Over and over, the simplest strategy, a cooperative program called Tit for Tat, shut out the competition. In other words, cooperation, not unfettered competition, turns out to be our best chance for survival. A vital book for leaders and decision makers, The Evolution of Cooperation reveals how cooperative principles help us think better about everything from military strategy, to political elections, to family dynamics.},

  abstract = {MORE THAN 200 SUCCESSFUL MILITARY COUPS have taken place in 95 countries over the last 75 years. Although military involvement in politics seems to have diminished following the Cold War, the aftermath of the Arab Spring reminds us that the military still plays a critical role in the politics of many states, and institutional structures are key to understanding this role. This article discusses how a particular set of institutions shapes military elites' decisions regarding the form and degree of intervention in political processes when they face an undesirable chief executive. The broad literature on civil-military relations highlights the fact that military coups are only one form of military intervention in politics.1 In many cases, military elites try to find alternative, less costly options to achieve their ultimate political aims.2 These options include intervening in key political decision-making processes without overt military takeover. As long as they achieve their ultimate policy aims, military elites will not choose the most costly option, namely, a military coup. Coups, by definition, target the ouster of the sitting chief executive.3 When institutions provide a path for military elites to achieve their goals without the military overthrow of the chief executive, this article argues, they will pursue these less costly alternatives.},

  abstract = {We study how the structure of social media networks and the presence of fake news affects the degree of misinformation and polarization in a society. For that, we analyze a dynamic model of opinion exchange in which individuals have imperfect information about the true state of the world and exhibit bounded rationality. Key to the analysis is the presence of internet bots: agents in the network that spread fake news (e.g., a constant flow of biased information). We characterize how agents' opinions evolve over time and evaluate the determinants of long-run misinformation and polarization in the network. To that end, we construct a synthetic network calibrated to Twitter and simulate the information exchange process over a long horizon to quantify the bots' ability to spread fake news. A key insight is that significant misinformation and polarization arise in networks in which only 15\% of agents believe fake news to be true, indicating that network externality effects are quantitatively important. Higher bot centrality typically increases polarization and lowers misinformation. When one bot is more influential than the other (asymmetric centrality), polarization is reduced but misinformation grows, as opinions become closer the more influential bot's preferred point. Finally, we show that threshold rules tend to reduce polarization and misinformation. This is because, as long as agents also have access to unbiased sources of information, threshold rules actually limit the influence of bots.},

Coupling insights from economic voting and social identity theory, we consider how different groups in society may construe manufacturing job losses in contrasting ways. We argue that deindustrialization threatens dominant group status, leading some white voters in affected localities to favor candidates they believe will address economic distress and defend racial hierarchy. Examining three US presidential elections, we find white voters were more likely to vote for Republican challengers where manufacturing layoffs were high, whereas Black voters in hard-hit localities were more likely to vote for Democrats. In survey data, white respondents, in contrast to people of color, associated local manufacturing job losses with obstacles to individual upward mobility and with broader American economic decline. Group-based identities help explain divergent political reactions to common economic shocks.},

Based on the literature on motivated political reasoning and the theory about affective tipping points, this article hypothesizes that politicians tend to reject evidence that contradicts their prior attitudes, but that increasing the amount of evidence will reduce the impact of prior attitudes and strengthen their ability to interpret the information correctly. These hypotheses are examined using randomized survey experiments with responses from 954 Danish politicians, and results from this sample are compared to responses from similar survey experiments with Danish citizens. The experimental findings strongly support the hypothesis that politicians are biased by prior attitudes when interpreting information. However, in contrast to expectations, the findings show that the impact of prior attitudes               increases               when more evidence is provided.},

In this alternative account the middle classes play the role of 'traditional intellectuals', that is, they provide the key social resources for mobilization of NSMs and all social movements.},

Findings - The paper proposess that Islamist communications focus on eliciting change in emotional states, specifically inducing the paratelic-excitement mode, by focusing around a meta-narrative of Muslims as a unitary grouping self-defined as victim to Western aggression. It concludes that British Muslim respondents were unsympathetic to the Islamist ideological messaging contained in the sample of propaganda clips. Originality/value - The paper provides an insight into how British Muslims might respond to Islamist communications, indicating that, while most are not susceptible to inducement of paratelic-excitement, others are likely to be, dependent on which genre of clip is used, the messages contained therein, and who that clip is targeted at.},

One view has it that the Quebec electorate tends to behave in a monolithic fashion; the other, put by Cairns in 1968, claims that this phenomenon is ``a contrivance of the electoral system, not an autonomous social fact.'' The evidence shows that block voting, namely, the degree to which an electorate mobilizes behind the largest party, is much more pronounced in Quebec than it is in other provinces, and especially when compared to that in Ontario. Quebec is also more likely than Ontario to determine which party forms the government. The tendency of the electoral system to magnify seat allocations to the largest party, however, is only marginally greater in Quebec relative to Ontario. At the same time, the composition of the Quebec ``block'' vote has varied considerably over time; it has not always been a distinctively francophone phenomenon. The article further challenges the assumption that the single-member plurality system is inherently inferior to proportional representation as a means of securing the protection of minorities in ethnically diverse societies., Cet article considere deux points de vue diff{\'e}rents {\`a} propos du vote en bloc au Qu{\'e}bec lors des {\'e}lections f{\'e}d{\'e}rales. L'un de ces points de vue est que l'{\'e}lectorat qu{\'e}b{\'e}cois a tendance {\`a} se comporter de mani{\`e}re monolithique; le second point de vue, que Cairns a exprim{\'e} en 1968, avance que ce ph{\'e}nom{\`e}ne est <<une cr{\'e}ation du syst{\`e}me {\'e}lectoral, pas un fait social autonome>>. Les statistiques r{\'e}v{\`e}lent que le vote en bloc, c'est-{\`a}-dire le degr{\'e} auquel l'{\'e}lectorat se mobilise pour appuyer le plus grand parti, est un ph{\'e}nom{\`e}ne beaucoup plus marqu{\'e} au Qu{\'e}bec que dans les autres provinces, et en particulier en comparaison avec l'Ontario. D'autre part, le Qu{\'e}bec est sans doute plus en mesure de d{\'e}terminer quel parti va constituer le gouvernement que l'Ontario. La tendance du syst{\`e}me {\'e}lectoral a grossir les r{\'e}partitions des si{\`e}ges au parti le plus important, n'est toutefois que l{\'e}g{\`e}rement plus accentu{\'e}e au Qu{\'e}bec qu'en Ontario. Simultan{\'e}ment, la composition du vote en bloc du Qu{\'e}bec a consid{\'e}rablement vari{\'e} au cours du temps; cela n'a pas toujours {\'e}t{\'e} un ph{\'e}nom{\`e}ne francophone distinct. En outre, l'article remet en question l'hypoth{\`e}se selon laquelle le syst{\`e}me de circonscription uninominale {\`a} scrutin majoritaire est un moins bon moyen que le syst{\`e}me d'{\'e}lection {\`a} la proportionnelle pour assurer la protection des minorit{\'e}s dans des soci{\'e}t{\'e}s compos{\'e}es d'ethnies diverses.},

This article argues that this reversal was neither temporary nor unique. Not only has the regional minister system been evident in the policies and operations of the Mulroney cabinet (1984-88) but its overall strength and persistence has probably been undervalued. The specific form of regional ministerial influence under Mulroney, namely the emergence of a limited number of regional figures exercising significant influence over major projects, is examined. To account for the role of regional ministers in both the Trudeau and Mulroney cabinets, attention is drawn to two factors - the complexities of the modern administrative state and the rise of modern competitive federalism - ironically the same factors usually cited in connection with the decline of regional ministers.},

Using NES data from 1972 to 2004, the authors model trends in issue partisanship---the correlation of issue attitudes with party identification---and issue alignment---the correlation between pairs of issues---and find a substantive increase in issue partisanship, but little evidence of issue alignment. The findings suggest that opinion changes correspond more to a resorting of party labels among voters than to greater constraint on issue attitudes: since parties are more polarized, they are now better at sorting individuals along ideological lines. Levels of constraint vary across population subgroups: strong partisans and wealthier and politically sophisticated voters have grown more coherent in their beliefs. The authors discuss the consequences of partisan realignment and group sorting on the political process and potential deviations from the classic pluralistic account of American politics.},

Research to date into political marketing has offered limited insights into different national contexts and involves only the study of political parties or of particular political campaigns. Research into government policy-making and political marketing is also immature. The present analysis of political marketing and EU integration addresses this gap in the research. More specifically, following a deductive approach, this paper investigates whether EU policy-making conforms to the Lees-Marshment political organisation behaviour model, in particular, its market-orientation element. It argues that the decline in popular support for European integration is the result of a lack of market orientation in EU policy-making. Group social psychology is deemed to be at the root of public dissatisfaction with EU policy-making and the lack of market orientation of the latter. While pressure from voters (the market) should not feed directly into EU policy-making without any input from political organisations, public consultation on EU policy should take place at all stages of the policy process.},

This interdisciplinary union has drastically changed the way political scientists examine the origins and effects of partisanship. In this essay, I provide a brief history of scholarship on partisanship, its transformation into a partisan identity as well as its role in the study of polarization. I then demonstrate how this identity framework has propelled research on negative partisan identity in the U.S. two-party system and European multi-party systems. I conclude with a few avenues for future research that could enrich our understanding of partisanship. Scholarship on partisanship has been transformed by political scientists' embrace of social and cognitive psychology in the past few decades. Since then, the concept of partisan identity has become widely known beyond the narrow subfield of political psychology. Indeed, the sheer volume of research on the origins, measurement, and effect of partisan identity on political behavior is indicative of its centrality in the general discipline of political science. In this essay, I provide a brief (and therefore necessarily incomplete) history of scholarship on partisanship as well as its transformation into a partisan identity . I then review contemporary research on positive and negative partisan identity in the U.S. and beyond, focusing on their differential effects on political attitudes and behavior. Last, I sketch out a few thoughts on the complexities and caveats of current scholarship, including a plea for more research on the interaction of partisanship with other identities, the necessity of studying partisanship in more externally valid contexts, as well as the promise of common identities in bridging partisan divisions.},

In-depth analysis of public attitudes finds remarkably little tension between ethnic diversity and public support for social programs in Canada. At first glance, then, the country seems to demonstrate the political viability of a multicultural welfare state. But this pattern reflects distinctive features of the institutional context within which public attitudes evolve. The Canadian policy regime has forestalled tension between diversity and redistribution by diverting adjustment pressures from the welfare state, absorbing some of them in other parts of the policy regime, and nurturing a more inclusive form of identity. These institutional buffers are thinning, however, potentially increasing the danger of greater tension between diversity and redistribution in the years to come.},

We observed that information was exchanged primarily among individuals with similar ideological preferences in the case of political issues (e.g., 2012 presidential election, 2013 government shutdown) but not many other current events (e.g., 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, 2014 Super Bowl). Discussion of the Newtown shootings in 2012 reflected a dynamic process, beginning as a national conversation before transforming into a polarized exchange. With respect to both political and nonpolitical issues, liberals were more likely than conservatives to engage in cross-ideological dissemination; this is an important asymmetry with respect to the structure of communication that is consistent with psychological theory and research bearing on ideological differences in epistemic, existential, and relational motivation. Overall, we conclude that previous work may have overestimated the degree of ideological segregation in social-media usage.},

The study utilises a worldwide sample across 41 different countries for the year 2008, covering 113 leading national broadsheet newspapers. A cross-sectional regression model is used to identify whether and how a range of contextual factors impact coverage of climate change. To a certain extent, a country's direct exposure to climate change and the measures that have been taken to combat global warming influence the position of climate change on the media agenda. Crucially, however, we identify a number of contextual factors that impact climate change-related media coverage in different national contexts. In particular, we find a significantly positive relationship between regulatory quality and levels of media coverage. At the same time, unemployment trends are significantly negatively related to media attention to climate change. Gross domestic product per capita does not help to explain levels of climate change-related media coverage. In other words, climate change appears to have moved beyond simply being a `rich country issue'.},

  abstract = {Human prestige systems are symbolic in nature and thus culturally patterned, though agonism lurks beneath all such systems. In both humans and chimpanzees, they may serve to permit learning from the high ranked and the successful. However, reliance on socially transmitted (cultural) information would be maladaptive without evolved mechanisms to screen out harmful information and retain the useful. One of these filters is preferential attention to the prestigious because prestige can be earned by skill and success. Prestige and dominance, like their underlying sentiments of respect and fear, are intertwined components of often complex and mutable social relationships; these components can be separated experimentally and mathematically but co-occur and evolved together. The evolution of our symbolic (culturally determined) prestige systems most likely involved sexual selection breaking down our ancestral social hierarchies into what we have today: multiple sets of symbolic criteria for the assessment of relative standing, with most sets being marked by competition in terms of a standard of excellence. Symbolic prestige allocation systems would have favored the evolution of cooperation over overt rivalry because they permit cryptic disagreement about relative standing, muting overt conflict and thus, perhaps, permitting the rise of complex, socially stratified societies. Culture does not so much get ``transmitted'' as edited, revised, inferred, and filtered. It is unclear to what extent we were selected to have knowledge-domain-specific mechanisms for cultural learning; an alternative hypothesis is that we rely on preferential attention and learning from the high-in-status across diverse knowledge domains, but that evolution has produced ``switches'' that influence, on the basis of our age, sex, and current status position, which individuals we find prestigious. The corollary of paying preferential attention to the high-in-status is ignoring the low: It often takes an ideology or moral imperative to get the higher ranked to pay attention to them. Apparent lack of compassion for the poor or disabled may often simply be inattention. Mass media challenge the filtering role of preferential attention to the high-in-status because they devalue the coin of local prestige. Today, we risk learning irrelevancies from apparently prestigious strangers at the expense of relevant knowledge learned from locally successful individuals.},

The other assesses the politics of inequality in the wake of the Occupy Wall Street movement, the 2012 election, and the partisan gridlock of Obama's second term. Larry Bartels offers a sobering account of the barriers to change posed by partisan ideologies and the political power of the wealthy. He also provides new analyses of tax policy, partisan differences in economic performance, the struggle to raise the minimum wage, and inequalities in congressional representation.President Obama identified inequality as ``the defining challenge of our time.'' Unequal Democracy is the definitive account of how and why our political system has failed to rise to that challenge. Now more than ever, this is a book every American needs to read.},

In an attempt to systematize and take stock of the nascent behavioral public administration scholarship, the authors trace it back to the seminal works of three Nobel Laureates---Herbert Simon, Daniel Kahneman, and Richard Thaler---and their work on bounded rationality, cognitive biases, and nudging, respectively. The cognitive biases investigated by the studies reviewed fall into the categories of accessibility, loss aversion, and overconfidence/optimism. Nudging and choice architecture are discussed as viable strategies for leveraging these cognitive traps in an attempt to alter behavior for the better, among both citizens and public servants.},

Left and right are, however, abstract political concepts and may trigger different associations among respondents. If these associations vary systematically with other variables this may induce bias in the empirical study of ideology. We illustrate this problem using a unique survey that asked respondents open-ended questions regarding the meanings they attribute to the concepts "left" and "right". We assess and categorize this textual data using topic modeling techniques. Our analysis shows that variation in respondents' associations is systematically related to their self-placement on the left-right scale and also to variables such as education and respondents' cultural background (East vs. West Germany). Our findings indicate that the interpersonal comparability of the left-right scale across individuals is impaired. More generally, our study suggests that we need more research on how respondents interpret various abstract concepts that we regularly use in survey questions.},

The authors retain all the substance of their contention that short-term, single-issue analyses cast public policy too narrowly as the result of cozy and dependable arrangements among politicians, interest groups, and the media. Jones and Baumgartner provide a different interpretation by taking the long view of several issues---including nuclear energy, urban affairs, smoking, and auto safety---to demonstrate that bursts of rapid, unpredictable policy change punctuate the patterns of stability more frequently associated with government. Featuring a new introduction and two additional chapters, this updated edition ensures that their findings will remain a touchstone of policy studies for many years to come.},

Using data from large, representative samples of consumers from 11 countries of the European Union, the authors find systematic effects of response styles on scale scores as a function of two scale characteristics (the proportion of reverse-scored items and the extent of deviation of the scale mean from the midpoint of the response scale) and show that correlations between scales can be biased upward or downward depending on the correlation between the response style components. In combination with the apparent lack of concern with response styles evidenced in a secondary analysis of commonly used marketing scales, these findings suggest that marketing researchers should pay greater attention to the phenomenon of stylistic responding when constructing and using measurement instruments.},

We examine how messages of party conflict and cooperation affect public opinion regarding national security, as well as whether and how the reputations of media outlets matter. We develop a typology of partisan messages in the news, determining their likely effects based on the characteristics of the speaker, listener, news outlet, and message content. We hypothesize that criticism of a Republican president by his fellow partisan elites should be exceptionally damaging (especially on a conservative media outlet), while opposition party praise of the president should be the most helpful (especially on a liberal outlet). We test our hypotheses through an experiment and a national survey on attitudes regarding the Iraq War. The results show that credible communication (i.e., "costly" rhetoric harmful to a party) is more influential than "cheap talk" in moving public opinion. Ironically, news media outlets perceived as ideologically hostile can actually enhance the credibility of certain messages relative to "friendly" news sources.}

  abstract = {In "Any Good News in Soft News?" Markus Prior investigates whether, beyond enhancing their attentiveness to select political issues (Baum, 2002a), consumers also learn about politics from soft news. He presents evidence suggesting that the audience for soft news is much smaller than that for hard news, and that a self-expressed preference for soft news outlets is associated with at most sporadic gains in factual political knowledge. In this commentary, I argue that the audience for soft news outlets is, in fact, quite large, even rivaling that for hard news. I further argue that long-term retention of factual political knowledge--the focus of Prior's web-based survey--is an overly restrictive definition of learning. By broadening our definition--taking into account recent insights from cognitive and social psychology concerning human information processing--it becomes possible to understand how consuming soft news might indeed be associated with learning about politics, but not necessarily with an enhanced long-term store of factual political knowledge. I present evidence that consuming soft news influences the attitudes of politically inattentive individuals and that, in at least some fairly predictable contexts, doing so is also associated with enhanced factual political knowledge. I conclude that while Prior's finding of an absence of evidence of consistent factual political knowledge effects represents a valuable contribution to our understanding of the political significance of the soft news media, it does not constitute compelling evidence of absence of any meaningful learning about politics associated with consuming soft news. Hence, it is premature to conclude that there is no good news in soft news.},

This evolution in news diffusion comes at a time when Americans report increased affective partisan polarization. In particular, evidence shows increasingly negative attitudes about out-party members. Based on selective exposure and reinforcing spirals model perspectives, we examined the reciprocal relationship between Facebook news use and polarization using national 3-wave panel data collected during the 2016 US Presidential Election. Over the course of the campaign, we found media use and attitudes remained relatively stable. Our results also showed that Facebook news use was related to a modest over-time spiral of depolarization. Furthermore, we found that people who use Facebook for news were more likely to view both pro- and counter-attitudinal news in each wave. Our results indicated that counter-attitudinal news exposure increased over time, which resulted in depolarization. We found no evidence of a parallel model, where pro-attitudinal exposure stemming from Facebook news use resulted in greater affective polarization.},

Achen and Bartels argue that the ``folk theory of democracy'' is not an accurate description of democracy in the United States and that without a greater degree of economic and social equality, democracy will remain an unattainable ideal. But their account of the gap between ideal and actual relies too heavily on the innate cognitive limitations and biases (particularly intergroup bias) of our psychology. These are important, but they provide only an incomplete understanding if we do not incorporate a focus on information and ideas. Media-effects research and comparative media studies provide evidence that the ignorance of the U.S. voter is only partly caused by cognitive limitations, and they point the way to a more effective way to bring social psychology into political science.},

  abstract = {Abstract: This article describes the evolution of three different models in educational policy-making in Ontario. In the late 1960s, education policy moved away from reliance on a traditional, centralized, administrative-agency approach and gravitated towards a decentralized, asymmetrical policy interdependence that dominated until the mid-1990s. The ndp government erected a more centralized scaffolding, with the centre undertaking a greater tutelary role vis {\`a} vis local authorities. The aim was to make more transparent the rules and standards by which local authorities, trustees and educators would operate and be held accountable. The education minister also sought to bolster local democracy by widening local parental participation in decision-making, Since 1995, the Conservative government has erected a politicized administrative agency that has adopted a confrontational stance towards stakeholders, reduced the powers of school board trustees, decimated middle-level professional staffing, and muffled teacher union executives. Decision-making now seems to reside with Harris advisers and key cabinet ministers, whose stance is driven by an amalgam of neo-liberal and neo-conservative ideology and by voter opinion. This neo-conservative approach differs in its embrace of a social conservatism - that government maintain social order and that excessive concern for individual choice and liberty not be allowed to undermine it. Harris' social conservatism, in its K-12 reforms, includes an embrace of regulation, hierarchy, monopoly and uniformity in the design of public policy. Sommaire: Cet article d{\'e}crit l'{\'e}volution de trois mod{\`e}les diff{\'e}rents d'{\'e}laboration de politiques en mati{\`e}re d'{\'e}ducation en Ontario. Vers la fin des an{\'e}bes 1960, ces politiques d'{\'e}ducation ne suivaient plus l'approche classique et centralis{\'e}e caract{\'e}ristique d'un organisme administratif; elles tendaient plut{\^o}t vers une interd{\'e}pendance d{\'e}centralis{\'e}e et asym{\'e}trique, qui pr{\'e}domina jusqu'au milieu des ann{\'e}es 1990. Le gouvemement n{\'e}o-d{\'e}mocrate {\'e}rigea une structure plus centralis{\'e}e qui accordait au centre un plus grand r{\^o}le tutelaire par rapport aux autorit{\'e}s locales. Ceci, aux fins d'une plus grande transparence des r{\`e}gles et normes de fonctionnement et de redev-abilit{\'e} pour les autorit{\'e}s locales, les conseillers scolaires et les enseignants. Le minis-tre de l'{\'E}ducation s'est efforc{\'e} aussi de favoriser la d{\'e}mocratic locale en amplifiant la participation parentale dans la prise de d{\'e}cisions. Depuis 1995, le gouvemement conservateur a {\'e}ig{\'e} un organisme administratif politicis{\'e} qui a adopt{\'e} des positions conflictuelles envers les intervenants, qui a r{\'e}duit les pouvoirs des conseillers scolaires et qui a sabr{\'e} dans les rangs du personnel professionnel de niveau interm{\'e}di-aire tout en muselant les dirigeants syndicaux des enseignants. II semblerait que les d{\'e}cisions sont maintenant prises par les conseillers de Harris et par certains de ses ministres - cl{\'e}, pouss{\'e}s par l'opinion des {\'e}lecteurs et une id{\'e}logie {\`a} la fois n{\'e}o-lib{\'e}rale et n{\'e}o-conservatrice. Cette approche n{\'e}o-conservatrice embrasse un certain conservatisme social: le gouvemement doit maintenir l'ordre social qui ne doit pas {\^e}tre sap{\'e} par une trop grande pr{\'e}ocupation concemant la libert{\'e} et les choix personnels. Le conservatisme social de Harris dans le cadre des r{\'e}formes scolaires fait appel {\`a} la r{\'e}glementation, {\`a} la hi{\'e}rarchie, au monopole et {\`a} l'uniformit{\'e} dans l'{\'e}laboration des politiques gouvemementales.},

Is there a country-specific dimension to this theory? This article addresses these contradictory findings by modeling both the individual-level budget preferences of bureaucrats while also accounting for country-level political and economic variables. It is hypothesized that those public servants in bureaus directly impacted by increases in spending should want more government spending than those who are not. Additionally, bureaucrats should have no uniform preference for spending on government transfer payments. While the economic and political contexts of the countries also impacted preferences, hierarchical random intercept models using data from the International Social Survey Program in almost two dozen countries found robust support for the hypotheses. These results support the notion that bureaucrats are budget-maximizers, but that this behavior is largely confined to their specific bureau; furthermore, this article finds international support for these hypotheses.},

This article takes a critical look at the Policy Paradox and at the claim that paying close attention to narratives is essential to the analysis of policy change. Drawing on recent scholarship on the role of ideas in public policy, the article shows that the analysis of narratives is part of a broader intellectual project associated with the ideational turn in policy analysis. The article explains how the analysis of narrative stories should take institutional factors into account, which can shape policy decisions. To illustrate these theoretical claims, the article analyzes the debate over public pension reform in the United States and Canada during the last 25 years. More specifically, the article compares the reform of the Canada Pension Plan during the mid1990s and the failed push to privatize US Social Security during the Bill Clinton and the George W. Bush presidencies. The analysis stresses that, while narrative stories shape problem definition, institutional legacies influence policy adoption.},

It is free to read at Oxford Scholarship Online and offered as a free PDF download from OUP and selected open access locations. Is social media destroying democracy? Are Russian propaganda or "Fake news" entrepreneurs on Facebook undermining our sense of a shared reality? A conventional wisdom has emerged since the election of Donald Trump in 2016 that new technologies and their manipulation by foreign actors played a decisive role in his victory and are responsible for the sense of a "post-truth" moment in which disinformation and propaganda thrives. Network Propaganda challenges that received wisdom through the most comprehensive study yet published on media coverage of American presidential politics from the start of the election cycle in April 2015 to the one year anniversary of the Trump presidency. Analysing millions of news stories together with Twitter and Facebook shares, broadcast television and YouTube, the book provides a comprehensive overview of the architecture of contemporary American political communications. Through data analysis and detailed qualitative case studies of coverage of immigration, Clinton scandals, and the Trump Russia investigation, the book finds that the right-wing media ecosystem operates fundamentally differently than the rest of the media environment. The authors argue that longstanding institutional, political, and cultural patterns in American politics interacted with technological change since the 1970s to create a propaganda feedback loop in American conservative media. This dynamic has marginalized centre-right media and politicians, radicalized the right wing ecosystem, and rendered it susceptible to propaganda efforts, foreign and domestic. For readers outside the United States, the book offers a new perspective and methods for diagnosing the sources of, and potential solutions for, the perceived global crisis of democratic politics.},

Anecdotal concerns about the problem reached their peak of sophistication in the writings of Walter Lippmann and Joseph Schumpeter. Not until Philip E. Converse's ``The Nature of Belief Systems in Mass Publics'' did statistical research overwhelmingly confirm the worst fears of such democratic skeptics. Subsequent work has tended to confirm Converse's picture of a tiny stratum of well-informed ideological elites whose passionate political debates find little echo, or even awareness, in the mass public. While a great deal of attention has been devoted to ``saving'' democratic legitimacy from such findings, the Converse-inspired work of John Zaller (1992) shows how fruitful Converse's basic ideas can be not only in analyzing real-world political events, but in pulling together and stimulating new lines of research into what moves the ``creative synthesizers'' of belief systems; into the factors that affect the small numbers of people who grasp such systems and attempt to transmit them to the public; and into the long-term psychological or cultural sources of the predispositions with which members of the mass public confront the resulting political messages.},

  abstract = {The gap between the richest and poorest Americans has grown steadily over the last thirty years, and economic inequality is on the rise in many other industrialized democracies as well. But the magnitude and pace of the increase differs dramatically across nations. A country's political system and its institutions play a critical role in determining levels of inequality in a society. Democracy, Inequality, and Representation argues that the reverse is also true---inequality itself shapes political systems and institutions in powerful and often overlooked ways. In Democracy, Inequality, and Representation, distinguished political scientists and economists use a set of international databases to examine the political causes and consequences of income inequality. The volume opens with an examination of how differing systems of political representation contribute to cross-national variations in levels of inequality. Torben Iverson and David Soskice calculate that taxes and income transfers help reduce the poverty rate in Sweden by over 80 percent, while the comparable figure for the United States is only 13 percent. Noting that traditional economic models fail to account for this striking discrepancy, the authors show how variations in electoral systems lead to very different outcomes. But political causes of disparity are only one part of the equation. The contributors also examine how inequality shapes the democratic process. Pablo Beramendi and Christopher Anderson show how disparity mutes political voices: at the individual level, citizens with the lowest incomes are the least likely to vote, while high levels of inequality in a society result in diminished electoral participation overall. Thomas Cusack, Iverson, and Philipp Rehm demonstrate that uncertainty in the economy changes voters' attitudes; the mere risk of losing one's job generates increased popular demand for income support policies almost as much as actual unemployment does. Ronald Rogowski and Duncan McRae illustrate how changes in levels of inequality can drive reforms in political institutions themselves. Increased demand for female labor participation during World War II led to greater equality between men and women, which in turn encouraged many European countries to extend voting rights to women for the first time. The contributors to this important new volume skillfully disentangle a series of complex relationships between economics and politics to show how inequality both shapes and is shaped by policy. Democracy, Inequality, and Representation provides deeply nuanced insight into why some democracies are able to curtail inequality---while others continue to witness a division that grows ever deeper.},

Most of this work, however, focuses on high-information races and ignores elections in which these cues are often unavailable (e.g. primary, local). In these cases, citizens are on their own to search for quality information and evaluate it efficiently. To assess how voters navigate this situation, we field three survey experiments asking respondents what information they want before voting. We evaluate respondents on their ability to both acquire and utilize information in a way that improves their chances of voting for quality candidates, and how this varies by the sophistication of respondents and the offices sought by candidates. We find strong evidence that voters use ``deal-breakers'' to quickly eliminate undesirable candidates; however, the politically unsophisticated rely on unverifiable, vague, and irrelevant search considerations. Moreover, less sophisticated voters also rely on more personalistic considerations. The findings suggest that voters' search strategies may be ineffective at identifying the best candidates for office, especially at the local level.},

Two survey series, using Environics and Gallup/Canadian Election Studies (CES) data, respectively, show that opinion on immigration was historically rather negative, became more positive from 1995 to 2005, and then stabilized. Native-born Canadians are now almost as positive toward immigration as immigrants themselves. However, recent aggregate stability masks a sharp polarization post-2005. Panel data from 2004 to 2011 shows that respondents who want less immigration are more likely to shift their partisanship to the right. Conversely, there is no evidence that immigration opinion systematically changed to match partisanship. This suggests that the predominant mechanism is sorting, rather than opinion change, at least in the period examined. Finally, is immigration likely to become an increasing source of political conflict in Canada? It depends on how competition at both ends of the political spectrum structures the interests of the major parties.},

Scientists believe strongly that they should have a role in public debates and view policy-makers as the most important group with which to engage.

  abstract = {Abstract. Canadian provinces have long been considered as ``small worlds,'' each with its own cultural distinctiveness and province-building dynamics. This article examines whether these same provincial specificities are observed in terms of attitudes toward immigration intakes and racial diversity. Three questions are asked. First, are there important variations in views toward immigration and racial minorities across Canadian provinces within the native-born white Canadian population? Second, have the differences and similarities changed between 1988 and 2008? And third, do specific provincial economic, demographic, and cultural realities shape provincial public opinion on these matters? The findings indicate that there are significant differences and commonalities in how all provinces react to immigration and racial diversity, that native-born white Canadians have grown increasingly accepting of immigration and racial diversity over time and that views toward immigration and racial diversity are distinct from each other and each responds to a specific set of provincial realities.R{\'e}sum{\'e}.

A series of LEXIS-NEXIS searches was performed between April and October 1998 for news stories and broadcast news transcripts from 1990 to the present that focused either on news media coverage or the practice of journalism. Stories were taken from major daily newspapers in the United States and broadcast transcripts from ABC, CBS, NBC, and CNN. In all, nearly 3,500 source citations from 677 newspaper stories and 131 broadcast news transcripts were coded. The analysis revealed that former CBS reporter Marvin Kalb was the most frequently cited source during this period, followed by Washington Post Executive Editor Leonard Downie, author and University of Virginia Professor Larry Sabato, Bill Kovach, a former journalist now affiliated with the Nieman Journalism Fellowships, Robert Lichter, director of the Center for Media and Public Affairs, and Los Angeles Times Editor Shelby Coffey.

  abstract = {Did Canadian voters choose Justin Trudeau in 2015, or did they choose the Liberal Party? Did British voters choose David Cameron in 2014, or did they choose to be led by a Conservative? In parliamentary systems around the world, no direct link exists between voters and leadership candidates in the way they are connected in presidential systems, and yet, studies suggest that voters consider party leaders when casting their ballot (Bittner 2011), and that this connection between the vote and the leader of the party is becoming increasingly important (Mughan 2000; Poguntke \& Webb 2005). Scholars of comparative party systems and institutions have pointed to declining partisanship, increased voter volatility, and the changing nature of media and campaigns as the key reasons for the ``presidentialization'' of politics and the increasing importance of leaders in the minds of voters. There is mixed evidence for this phenomenon, however, and while in some countries (such as Israel), the pattern of increasing personalization is clear (Rahat and Sheafer, 2007), in others (such as Germany), personalization does not appear to be there (Kaase, 1994; Kriesi, 2011). Most (although not all) studies of presidentialization focus their analyses on Europe, and yet there are plenty of non-European parliamentary systems we can (and should) assess as well, to determine whether presidentialization is a global phenomenon as some suggest. This paper turns to Canada. What is the relationship between voters and party leaders in the Canadian context? Do party leaders in Canada matter? How and why? And has this relationship changed over time? Are we seeing a presidentialization of Canadian elections? This paper assesses the role of leaders in Canadian elections over time, using Canadian Election Study Data from 1984 to 2015. The data suggest that party leaders matter, but that this has always been the case in Canada: elections are not becoming more personalized over time.},

It explores developments in the political landscape from both historical and contemporary perspectives and speculates on the future of the national party system.

  abstract = {Decentralization of governance is an emerging trend in many natural resource sectors in both developed and developing countries. Despite the normative agenda of community-based natural resource management for social and ecological outcomes, a shift to multilevel or polycentric theorizing is warranted. Polycentric governance recognizes the importance of cross-scale interactions, as well as the horizontal and vertical institutional linkages of authority, networks, and markets in which community institutions are embedded. Based on qualitative community forestry research in Revelstoke, British Columbia, Canada, this article explores the themes of livelihood and local economy, collaborative forest planning and participation, and environmental governance. Bottom-up empirical evidence suggests that viewing community forestry through a polycentric governance network is necessary for theorizing complex cross-scale dynamics. Incentivizing policies that encourage the development of polycentric systems for natural resource governance is important for maintaining local benefits, while increasing adaptive capacity to deal with complex social--ecological challenges.},

Although this suggests that researchers should measure potential moderators before administering the treatment in an experiment, doing so may also bias causal effect estimation if the covariate measurement primes respondents to react differently to the treatment. This paper formally analyzes this trade-off between post-treatment and priming biases in three experimental designs that vary when moderators are measured: pre-treatment, post-treatment, or a randomized choice between the two. We derive nonparametric bounds for interactions between the treatment and the moderator in each design and show how to use substantive assumptions to narrow these bounds. These bounds allow researchers to assess the sensitivity of their empirical findings to either source of bias. We extend the basic framework in two ways. First, we apply the framework to the case of post-treatment attention checks and bound how much inattentive respondents can attenuate estimated treatment effects. Second, we develop a parametric Bayesian approach to incorporate pre-treatment covariates in the analysis to sharpen our inferences and quantify estimation uncertainty. We apply these methods to a survey experiment on electoral messaging. We conclude with practical recommendations for scholars designing experiments.},

Finally, studies that include a wide set of democracies find turnout to be higher under more proportional systems, but the reported impact is quite small.

The first stage of the inquiry determines whether voters' expectations about the outcome of the election have an independent effect on vote choice, after controlling their preferences, more specifically their party identification and evaluations of parties and leaders. We show that in the 1997 Canadian election perceptions of the local race in the constituency did affect the vote, but not perceptions of the race for who would form the government and the official opposition. The second stage of the analysis consists in assessing for each respondent whether her vote was sincere or strategic: a respondent is deemed to have cast a strategic vote if whether her expectations about the outcome of the election are considered or not leads to a different prediction about which party she is most likely to support. On that basis, we estimate that about 3\% of voters cast a strategic vote in the 1997 election.  2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {What drives individuals toward a career in politics? Prior research on political ambition has often focused on socio-demographic variables while generally ignoring the importance of individual personality differences. Yet personality consistently predicts political knowledge, interest and participation, suggesting that individual differences may matter in addition to resources and the social environment. To this end, we assess the impact of both the HEXACO and Dark Triad models of personality in predicting nascent political ambition (that is, the initial desire to run for elected office) while controlling for well-established socio-demographic variables (for example, gender, income). Overall, we find considerable support for the predictive power of personality, especially the traits of honesty-humility, extraversion and narcissism. These results have important implications for understanding the kinds of people who are interested in a political career., Qu'est-ce qui incite certaines personnes {\`a} se lancer en politique ?

He gives a historical review of the origin of the ``notwithstanding'' clause as it appears in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, enacted in 1982. In the course of so doing, he appears to propose a distinction between ``rights'' -- those claims which are included in the Charter, and ``policies'' -- those claims which are protected by the activities of the legislative and executive arms of government. This is, I argue, a false dichotomy. It leads to the conclusion that the use of the ``notwithstanding'' clause can only amount to a suspension of rights in favour of achieving government policy.},

  abstract = {In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Waffle movement in the New Democratic Party (NDP) emerged as a leading proponent of Canadian left economic nationalism. The Waffle, which formed around the ``Manifesto for an Independent and Socialist Canada'' and challenged the leadership of the NDP from 1969 to 1973, represents a dynamic convergence of many of the social movements that comprised the New Left in Canada. This article examines the evolution of the Waffle's position on international unionism alongside the reaction of pro-NDP labour leaders to this New Left incursion into the party. NDP-allied labour leaders expressed suspicion and concern for the group's agenda almost from its inception. The Waffle's success in appealing to younger and nationalist-minded members of international unions turned suspicion into active opposition. As polarization within the NDP increased, workers' support for the Waffle within the Canadian labour movement led moderate union leaders to conclude the group must be expunged from the Ontario NDP. Ironically, after the Waffle's departure from the party the group largely repudiated nationalist breakaways from international unions while, in the ensuing decades, the mainstream labour movement embraced Canadian nationalism. {\`A} la fin des ann{\'e}es soixante et au d{\'e}but des ann{\'e}es soixante-dix, le mouvement Waffle se d{\'e}finit au sein du Nouveau Parti D{\'e}mocratique (NPD) en tant que promoteur principal d'un nationalisme {\'e}conomique de gauche canadien. Fond{\'e} sur les id{\'e}es mises de l'avant dans son <<Manifeste pour un Canada ind{\'e}pendant et socialiste>>, le Waffle illustre la convergence de plusieurs mouvements sociaux qui caract{\'e}risent la nouvelle gauche canadienne et se fait critique du leadership n{\'e}o-d{\'e}mocrate de 1969 {\`a} 1973. Le pr{\'e}sent article propose d'examiner l'{\'e}volution de la position du Waffle en ce qui a trait au syndicalisme international, en parall{\`e}le aux r{\'e}actions des leaders syndicaux pro-NPD face {\`a} l'incursion de la nouvelle gauche au sein du parti. Ceux-ci expriment leurs pr{\'e}occupations {\`a} l'{\'e}gard des intentions du groupe, qu'ils voient d'un mauvais {\oe}il depuis sa constitution. L'attrait qu'exerce le Waffle aupr{\`e}s des plus jeunes membres des syndicats internationaux transforme ces pr{\'e}occupations en opposition active. Alors que le NPD se trouve de plus en plus polaris{\'e}, l'appui des travailleurs {\`a} l'{\'e}gard du Waffle au sein du mouvement syndical canadien pousse les leaders syndicaux mod{\'e}r{\'e}s {\`a} chercher son expulsion du NPD ontarien. Ironiquement, apr{\`e}s son d{\'e}part du parti, le Waffle d{\'e}nonce en grande partie les nationalistes rompant avec les syndicats internationaux, tandis que dans les d{\'e}cennies qui suivent, le mouvement syndical se fait sympatisant du nationalisme canadien.},

The study identifies conflicts along race and age: Visible minority and younger nurses report more conflict, with visible minority nurses particularly vulnerable and racially marginalized. Members of Visible minorities and young nurses responded to workplace conflict by demonstrating competence, seeking support from colleagues, and either ignoring the abuse or standing up for themselves. These strategies do nothing to challenge professional unity. Nonetheless, intra-professional conflict has negative consequences for professionals and their work.},

  abstract = {The electoral district is the fundamental unit of representation in single- and multi-member electoral systems, yet most research shows little interest in district effects on election outcomes, focusing instead on national and individual factors. This is problematic as parties and candidates often put a great deal of effort into district-based campaigns. How, then, can we best capture district effects on party support? We propose a new method using official election returns and geospatial techniques. The result is a measure of how much of a party's vote share is explained by district effects. Using data from the 2006--2019 Canadian federal elections, we find that, on average, 6 to 10 per cent of the variation in a party's vote in Canada is explained by district effects. While district effects on party support are trivial for some districts, in others they account for more than 80 per cent of the variance in party vote shares. The effect of districts on party support is composed, in part, of electoral context, province, socio-economic factors and district campaign intensity. Importantly, the size and sources of district effects on party support vary across parties, suggesting heterogeneity. The benefits of our approach are threefold: (1) it is cost-effective, (2) it can be easily replicated in any setting---past or present---where districts are relevant electoral units and where districting is nonpartisan, and (3) it is responsive to differences in district composition and parties' campaign effort.},

  abstract = {How the 2016 news media environment allowed Trump to win the presidencyThe 2016 presidential election campaign might have seemed to be all about one man. He certainly did everything possible to reinforce that impression. But to an unprecedented degree the campaign also was about the news media and its relationships with the man who won and the woman he defeated.Words that Matter assesses how the news media covered the extraordinary 2016 election and, more important, what information---true, false, or somewhere in between---actually helped voters make up their minds. Using journalists' real-time tweets and published news coverage of campaign events, along with Gallup polling data measuring how voters perceived that reporting, the book traces the flow of information from candidates and their campaigns to journalists and to the public.The evidence uncovered shows how Donald Trump's victory, and Hillary Clinton's loss, resulted in large part from how the news media responded to these two unique candidates. Both candidates were unusual in their own ways, and thus presented a long list of possible issues for the media to focus on. Which of these many topics got communicated to voters made a big difference outcome.What people heard about these two candidates during the campaign was quite different. Coverage of Trump was scattered among many different issues, and while many of those issues were negative, no single negative narrative came to dominate the coverage of the man who would be elected the 45th president of the United States. Clinton, by contrast, faced an almost unrelenting news media focus on one negative issue---her alleged misuse of e-mails---that captured public attention in a way that the more numerous questions about Trump did not.Some news media coverage of the campaign was insightful and helpful to voters who really wanted serious information to help them make the most important decision a democracy offers. But this book also demonstrates how the modern media environment can exacerbate the kind of pack journalism that leads some issues to dominate the news while others of equal or greater importance get almost no attention, making it hard for voters to make informed choices.},

  abstract = {Political parties play a vital role in democracies by linking citizens to their representatives. Nonetheless, a longstanding concern is that partisan identification slants decision-making. Citizens may support (oppose) policies that they would otherwise oppose (support) in the absence of an endorsement from a political party---this is due in large part to what is called partisan motivated reasoning where individuals interpret information through the lens of their party commitment. We explore partisan motivated reasoning in a survey experiment focusing on support for an energy law. We identify two politically relevant factors that condition partisan motivated reasoning: (1) an explicit inducement to form an ``accurate'' opinion, and (2) cross-partisan, but not consensus, bipartisan support for the law. We further provide evidence of how partisan motivated reasoning works psychologically and affects opinion strength. We conclude by discussing the implications of our results for understanding opinion formation and the overall quality of citizens' opinions.},

I think we've made this a good place to work, and that the people who come here are really devoted to serving our customers and that probably makes me prouder than anything else. A: Running any large business right now is a really difficult and challenging task. And running a mature business -- and the Herald is 112 years old, it's been a part of this community as long as there's been a community. So when you're a steward for awhile you want to make sure the institution continues after your time is done. And the tough days have been, because we're in a very competitive business, with good competitors, when you look ahead and you think, ``Boy we've really got to do things right to survive.'' A: It's a mutual decision between myself and the company. I've led the organization for seven years, and I was very struck when Murray Fraser announced his resignation at the University of Calgary. Dick Haskayne, who's the chairman of the board at the university and the chairman of NOVA, noted at that time that the average tenure of a CEO in Canada is 612 years. So I'm beyond the average. And I recall thinking there's a reason why. You're starting to get tired, and you're starting to run out of energy. Leading a large organization is a very very time intensive and energy consuming task. So I'd rather go out and say ``My work is done.'' We've done a very extensive strategic plan this year and I think the newspaper is exceptionally well positioned for the future. It's a good newspaper, it's close to being a great newspaper. I think we've taken this paper pretty far and now it's time for someone who's got new ideas and new energy to take us into the future.},

However, longstanding disputes about the origins, legitimacy, and applicability of certain aspects of the legal system have led John Borrows to argue that Canada's constitution is incomplete without a broader acceptance of Indigenous legal traditions.With characteristic richness and eloquence, John Borrows explores legal traditions, the role of governments and courts, and the prospect of a multi-juridical legal culture, all with a view to understanding and improving legal processes in Canada. He discusses the place of individuals, families, and communities in recovering and extending the role of Indigenous law within both Indigenous communities and Canadian society more broadly. This is a major work by one of Canada's leading legal scholars, and an essential companion to Drawing Out Law: A Spirit's Guide.},

Indigenous law, however, has continuing relevance for both Aboriginal peoples and the Canadian state. In his in-depth examination of the continued existence and application of Indigenous legal values, John Borrows suggests how First Nations laws could be applied by Canadian courts, and tempers this by pointing out the many difficulties that would occur if the courts attempted to follow such an approach. By contrasting and comparing Aboriginal stories and Canadian case law, and interweaving political commentary, Borrows argues that there is a better way to constitute Aboriginal / Crown relations in Canada. He suggests that the application of Indigenous legal perspectives to a broad spectrum of issues that confront us as humans will help Canada recover from its colonial past, and help Indigenous people recover their country. Borrows concludes by demonstrating how Indigenous peoples' law could be more fully and consciously integrated with Canadian law to produce a society where two world views can co-exist and a different vision of the Canadian constitution and citizenship can be created.},

When considering whether we should believe this information, we assess whether the sources are independent, how reliable they are, and how plausible and coherent the information is. Bovens and Hartmann provide a systematic Bayesian account of these features of reasoning. Simple Bayesian Networks allow us to model alternative assumptions about the nature of the information sources. Measurement of the coherence of information is a controversial matter: arguably, the more coherent a set of information is, the more confident we may be that its content is true, other things being equal. The authors offer a new treatment of coherence which respects this claim and shows its relevance to scientific theory choice. Bovens and Hartmann apply this methodology to a wide range of much discussed issues regarding evidence, testimony, scientific theories, and voting. Bayesian Epistemology is an essential tool for anyone working on probabilistic methods in philosophy, and has broad implications for many other disciplines.},

We know that scandals can lower regard for individual politicians and government leaders. Yet, less is known about how scandal influences attitudes toward institutions and the political process. It has been widely assumed that such attitudes are influenced by factors that lie largely beyond the control of individual politicians. Using data from the U.S. and the U.K. we show that scandals involving legislators can have a negative influence on their constituent's attitudes toward institutions and the political process. One consequence of this finding is that, instead of looking for scapegoats in Hollywood or among the failings of voters themselves, politicians should first get their own House in order.},

But we know little about how emotional appeals actually influence voting behavior. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that political ads can change the way citizens get involved and make choices simply by using images and music to evoke emotions. Prior research suggests voters behave differently in different emotional states but has not established whether politicians can use campaigns to manipulate emotions and thereby cause changes in political behavior. This article uses two experiments conducted during an actual election to show that: (1) cueing enthusiasm motivates participation and activates existing loyalties; and (2) cueing fear stimulates vigilance, increases reliance on contemporary evaluations, and facilitates persuasion. These results suggest campaigns achieve their goals in part by appealing to emotions, and emotional appeals can promote democratically desirable behavior.},

One popular but untested suspicion is that reactions to news about the costs of immigration depend upon who the immigrants are. We confirm this suspicion in a nationally representative experiment: news about the costs of immigration boosts white opposition far more when Latino immigrants, rather than European immigrants, are featured. We find these group cues influence opinion and political action by triggering emotions---in particular, anxiety---not simply by changing beliefs about the severity of the immigration problem. A second experiment replicates these findings but also confirms their sensitivity to the stereotypic consistency of group cues and their context. While these results echo recent insights about the power of anxiety, they also suggest the public is susceptible to error and manipulation when group cues trigger anxiety independently of the actual threat posed by the group.},

As it became one of the best-selling methodology books in memory, it continued to spark debate in journal articles, conference panels, and books. Rethinking Social Inquiry is a major new effort by a broad range of leading scholars to offer a cohesive set of reflections on Designing Social Inquiry's quest for common standards drawn from quantitative methodology. While vigorously agreeing to the need for common standards, the essays in Rethinking Social Inquiry argue forcefully that these standards must be drawn from exemplary qualitative research as well as the best quantitative studies. The essays make the case that good social science requires a set of diverse tools for inquiry. Key additions to the seminal pieces gathered here include an original overview of Designing Social Inquiry, a new essay on evaluating causation, and a concluding chapter that draws together basic issues in the ongoing methodological debate.

  abstract = {Multiplicative interaction models are common in the quantitative political science literature. This is so for good reason. Institutional arguments frequently imply that the relationship between political inputs and outcomes varies depending on the institutional context. Models of strategic interaction typically produce conditional hypotheses as well. Although conditional hypotheses are ubiquitous in political science and multiplicative interaction models have been found to capture their intuition quite well, a survey of the top three political science journals from 1998 to 2002 suggests that the execution of these models is often flawed and inferential errors are common. We believe that considerable progress in our understanding of the political world can occur if scholars follow the simple checklist of dos and don'ts for using multiplicative interaction models presented in this article. Only 10\% of the articles in our survey followed the checklist.e-mail: thomas.brambor@nyu.edu e-mail: wrclark@umich.edu e-mail: matt.golder@nyu.edu (corresponding author)},

  abstract = {Hannah Arendt claims that Thomas Hobbes was responsible for constituting modern people as apolitical subjects who can no longer make independent moral judgments. The refusal to think that Hobbes allegedly engendered was a major factor in twentieth-century totalitarianism's worst crimes. In her view, Hobbes's Leviathan established the architecture of the totalitarian state and initiated the cultivation of people so incapable of exercising moral judgment that they stood idly by and let such a state commit horrors in their name. I argue that Hobbes rejected the proto-totalitarian form of domination Arendt attributes to him and expressed hope about the human capacities for practical judgment and moral improvement. Instead of creating thoughtless subjects which authorize any crime the state might commit, he suggests that the Leviathan should cultivate the public's capacity for reason and judgment to make violence unnecessary. Considering Hobbes's accounts of reason and science in light of his materialism shows that the Leviathan requires the exercise of individual moral thought and judgment to function properly. I suggest that the primary duty of the Hobbesian sovereign might be understood primarily in terms of the cultivation of individual judgment and reason rather than its suppression.},

This new view sees global environmentalism as the combined product of direct experiences of the citizens of "poorer" nations (objective problems thesis) with the subjective values shift of the citizens of "wealthier" countries (postmaterialist values thesis). Methods. Using two statistical tests, data from the 1992 Gallup Heath of the Planet survey and a two-dimensional measure of environmental concern, local and global, the paper examines citizen attitudes from twelve relatively wealthy countries against those from twelve relatively poor ones on fifteen different items. Results. While citizens from poorer countries (with relatively low numbers of postmaterialists) were far more concerned about local environmental problems than citizens from wealthier countries (with relatively high numbers of postmaterialists), no statistically significant differences between the two groups were found on questions concerning more symbolic global environmental problems. Conclusions. Using an objective problems plus subjective values explanation fails to describe adequately the bases of southern and northern environmental concern, respectively, and hence environmental concern globally. In addition, using a postmaterialist explanation for environmentalism at the wider cultural level becomes incoherent versus the much more modest claims found at the social-psychological level. In sum, global environmentalism is a complex social phenomenon consisting of multiple movements, driven by multiple engines requiring further specification and discussion.},

We draw on an original cross-national data set of election results from mayoral elections in Canada's 100 largest cities between 2006 and 2017. An average of 4.96 candidates contested mayoral elections in this period, and 16 per cent of all candidates were women. Density and mayoral prestige were related to higher numbers of candidates; in contrast, incumbent candidates and the availability of other elected positions were related to lower numbers. Notably, the presence of a female incumbent was related to higher numbers of women running for the position of mayor; in contrast, higher mayoral salaries were associated with an increase in the number of male but not female candidates. This analysis enhances our understanding of the factors underlying contested local elections, as well as the factors that appear to facilitate women contesting local elections., L'objectif de cet article est d'explorer les facteurs susceptibles d'influencer le nombre de candidats, et plus pr{\'e}cis{\'e}ment de candidates, qui se pr{\'e}sentent aux {\'e}lections municipales au Canada. {\`A} partir d'une base de donn{\'e}es portant sur les {\'e}lections {\`a} la mairie au sein des 100 plus grandes villes du Canada entre 2006 et 2017, nous montrons qu'en moyenne, au cours de cette p{\'e}riode, 4,96 candidats se sont pr{\'e}sent{\'e}s aux {\'e}lections municipales.

These attributes include social trust, social altruism, equality, tolerance, humanitarianism, and civic participation. The first five attributes provide soft evidence of social capital, but the last attribute---civic participation---is hard behavioral evidence. Finally, a rigorous test is applied: a multivariate model estimates the strength of public employment as a predictor of civic participation while it holds other theoretically important variables constant. The results show that public employment is a substantively important and highly significant predictor of civic participation. Overall, public servants are far more active in civic affairs than are other citizens, and they appear to be catalysts for the building of social capital in society at large.},

This study uses an experiment embedded within a public opinion survey to test the effects of exposure to such claims on public support for banning the use of BPA in products. Exposure to the claim that "there is not enough scientific evidence that BPA harms human health" reduced support, whereas exposure to the claim that there "is enough scientific evidence" failed to increase support. No effect emerged among those simultaneously exposed to both claims. The "not enough evidence" claim influenced less educated respondents and women but not college-educated respondents or men. Aspects of the underlying structure of opinion also differed depending on which claim(s) respondents received. The results illuminate how members of the public respond to competing scientific claims regarding controversial issues.}

Using the Labour Force Survey master files (1977-2010), I find that the increases in job stability first observed in the 1990s were, in fact, long lasting. Results indicate that compositional changes and the increased job stability of women within age and education groups play important roles in explaining the aggregate job stability patterns that emerge.

These linkages have often been challenging to study empirically owing to the limited availability of suitable data with which to link individual-level voting to aggregate-level policymaking, and also to enduring controversies in the study of mass political behavior. I discuss several new research programs that have begun to advance scholarly understanding of these political linkages. Underlying this work is progress in understanding the microfoundations of voting behavior, coupled with new analytical models of aggregate preferences. Following a discussion of these issues, I consider several innovative strains of research on opinion-policy linkages. This scholarship has significant potential for advancing empirical democratic theory and the study of linkages between voting behavior and other political processes.},

Students enrolled in an introductory comparative politics course (N = 180) and a sophomore-level survey course (N = 101) were randomly assigned to receive short instruction sessions in specific writing skills led by a faculty member or senior graduate student. In the first experiment, half the class received explicit instruction on writing (focusing on two specific skills from a comprehensive rubric that we subsequently coded their papers against) while the other half did not. In the second experiment, all students received general writing instruction, but the treatment group also received detailed instruction in the use of a writing-skills rubric that formed the basis for evaluating students' performance on written assignments. In both cases, the post-treatment difference between groups was small but showed an improvement in the specific skills taught, while showing no change or slightly decreased performance in related skills that were not explicitly taught. We conclude that limited interventions of the sort we were able to engage in were not sufficient to bring about a meaningful improvement in student performance, but the preliminary evidence suggests that the use of rubrics as a pedagogical tool, combined with repeated small-scale interventions, may be effective if targeted and/or repeated across a course or curriculum.},

  abstract = {From one of the world's preeminent political historians, a magisterial study of political leadership around the world from the advent of parliamentary democracy to the age of Obama.All too frequently, leadership is reduced to a simple dichotomy: the strong versus the weak. Yet, there are myriad ways to exercise effective political leadership--as well as different ways to fail. We blame our leaders for economic downfalls and praise them for vital social reforms, but rarely do we question what makes some leaders successful while others falter. In this magisterial and wide-ranging survey of political leadership over the past hundred years, renowned Oxford politics professor Archie Brown challenges the widespread belief that strong leaders--meaning those who dominate their colleagues and the policy-making process--are the most successful and admirable.In reality, only a minority of political leaders will truly make a lasting difference. Though we tend to dismiss more collegial styles of leadership as weak, it is often the most cooperative leaders who have the greatest impact. Drawing on extensive research and decades of political analysis and experience, Brown illuminates the achievements, failures and foibles of a broad array of twentieth century politicians. Whether speaking of redefining leaders like Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Lyndon Johnson, and Margaret Thatcher, who expanded the limits of what was politically possible during their time in power, or the even rarer transformational leaders who played a decisive role in bringing about systemic change--Charles de Gaulle, Mikhail Gorbachev and Nelson Mandela, among them--Brown challenges our commonly held beliefs about political efficacy and strength.Overturning many of our assumptions about the twentieth century's most important figures, Brown's conclusions are both original and enlightening. The Myth of the Strong Leader compels us to reassess the leaders who have shaped our world - and to reconsider how we should choose and evaluate those who will lead us into the future.},

But do the heterogeneous phenomena lumped under the rubric ``populist'' in fact belong together? Or is ``populism'' just a journalistic clich{\'e} and political epithet? In the first part of the article, I defend the use of ``populism'' as an analytic category and the characterization of the last few years as a ``populist moment,'' and I propose an account of populism as a discursive and stylistic repertoire. In the second part, I specify the structural trends and the conjunctural convergence of a series of crises that jointly explain the clustering in space and time that constitutes the populist moment. The question in my title is thus twofold: it is a question about populism as a term or concept and a question about populism as a phenomenon in the world. The article addresses both the conceptual and the explanatory question, limiting the scope of the explanatory argument to the pan-European and trans-Atlantic populist conjuncture of the last few years.},

  abstract = {People are remarkably accurate (approaching ceiling) at deciding whether faces are male or female, even when cues from hairstyle, makeup, and facial hair are minimised. Experiments designed to explore the perceptual basis of our ability to categorise the sex of faces are reported. Subjects were considerably less accurate when asked to judge the sex of three-dimensional (3-D) representations of faces obtained by laser-scanning, compared with a condition where photographs were taken with hair concealed and eyes closed. This suggests that cues from features such as eyebrows, and skin texture, play an important role in decisionmaking. Performance with the laser-scanned heads remained quite high with 3/4-view faces, where the 3-D shape of the face should be easiest to see, suggesting that the 3-D structure of the face is a further source of information contributing to the classification of its sex. Performance at judging the sex from photographs (with hair concealed) was disrupted if the photographs were inverted, which implies that the superficial cues contributing to the decision are not processed in a purely `local' way. Performance was also disrupted if the faces were shown in photographic negatives, which is consistent with the use of 3-D information, since negation probably operates by disrupting the computation of shape from shading. In 3-D, the `average' male face differs from the `average' female face by having a more protuberant nose/brow and more prominent chin/jaw. The effects of manipulating the shapes of the noses and chins of the laser-scanned heads were assessed and significant effects of such manipulations on the apparent masculinity or femininity of the heads were revealed. It appears that our ability to make this most basic of facial categorisations may be multiply determined by a combination of 2-D, 3-D, and textural cues and their interrelationships.},

We investigated reasons for the low vaccination uptake. Design: Cross-sectional survey, conducted in May 2004. Sample: We surveyed 225 health care personnel, potential members of smallpox response teams in Virginia, who were offered vaccination. We assessed respondents' acceptance of vaccination and its association with factors potentially influencing vaccination: perceptions of vaccine safety, contraindications, concerns about bioterrorism, and workplace influences. Results: Among nonvaccinees (n=44), 70\% had a contraindication to the vaccine compared with 8\% among vaccinees (n=132). The desire to prepare America for potential bioterrorist attack was associated with acceptance of smallpox vaccination (odds ratio [OR]: 17.7, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 3.6--85.9). Among respondents with contraindications, vaccinees reported more often than nonvaccinees having been asked by their supervisors to be vaccinated (OR: 5; 95\% CI: 1.1--22.1) and to have been concerned that their vaccination choice would affect positively their job evaluation (OR: 11; 95\% CI: 1.6--81.1). Conclusion: Concerns about bioterrorism and willingness to help in the preparedness effort were motivations for vaccination. Continued vigilance to avoid vaccination of those with contraindications is needed.},

  abstract = {Historically, self-regulation has provided some professions with power and market control. Currently, however, governments have scrutinized this approach, and priorities have shifted toward other mandates. This study examines the case of paramedics in Ontario, Canada, where self-regulation is still the dominant regulatory model for the healthcare professions but not for paramedics. Instead, paramedics in Ontario are co-regulated by government and physician-directed groups, with paramedics subordinate to both. This paper, which draws on interviews with paramedic industry leaders analyzed through the lens of institutional work, examines perspectives on the relevance of self-regulation to the paramedic professionalization project. Participants had varying views on the importance of self-regulation in obtaining professional status, with some rejecting its role in professionalization and others embracing regulatory reform. Because paramedics disagree on what being a profession means, the collective professionalization project has stalled. This research has implications for understanding the impact of intraprofessional relationships and conflict on professionalization projects.}

  abstract = {Neo-Marxist class categories, like conventional SES measures, generally predict only a small proportion of the variation in Canadian class voting. This has led some social scientists to downplay the role of class factors in shaping voting behaviour; some political scientists have gone so far as to abandon sociological models of voting behaviour altogether. In this paper we argue, first, that emphasizing the proportion of explained variance is a methodological fetish. It thus makes little sense to abandon particular models of voting behaviour on the grounds that explained variance is low. Second, in extending research on the relationship between class and voting, we criticize previous research for ignoring the complex social processes by which objective class position may or may not be transformed into subjective class action. We contend that studying how classes become politically mobilized or demobilized draws attention to a set of structural variables that markedly increase our confidence in the existence of a relationship between class and voting and therefore our understanding of this relationship. We substantiate our argument by performing logistic regression analyses on data from the 1968 Canadian Federal Election Survey and other sources. /// La fa{\c c}on dont les classes sont conceptualis{\'e}es par les n{\'e}o-marxistes n'est en g{\'e}n{\'e}ral capable de pr{\'e}dire qu'une faible proportion de la variation du vote classiste canadien. En cela cette conceptualisation s'apparente aux variables conventionnelles de statut socio-{\'e}conomique. Cela a entra{\^i}n{\'e} certains analystes {\`a} minimiser le r{\^o}le de facteurs classistes dans la formation du comportement {\'e}lectoral. Cet article s'inscrit en faux contre une telle ligne de pens{\'e}e. Nous sugg{\'e}rons d'abord que l'attention excessive accord{\'e}e {\`a} la proportion de variance expliqu{\'e}e rel{\`e}ve d'un f{\'e}tiche m{\'e}thodologique; en cons{\'e}quence, il est abusif d'abandonner certains mod{\`e}les de comportement {\'e}lectoral simplement {\`a} cause de la faible proportion de variance expliqu{\'e}e. Ensuite, nous explorons plus avant la relation entre classe et vote; et nous critiquons l'absence, dans les recherches ant{\'e}c{\'e}dentes, de consid{\'e}ration des processus sociaux complexes par l'interm{\'e}diaire desquels la position de classe objective peut se transformer en action de classe subjective. Nous soutenous que l'{\'e}tude de la fa{\c c}on dont les classes deviennent politiquement mobilis{\'e}es met en {\'e}vidence un ensemble de variables structurelles qui renouvelle notre confiance en l'existence d'une relation entre classe et vote. Notre compr{\'e}hension de ce ph{\'e}nom{\`e}ne en est ainsi am{\'e}lior{\'e}e. Nous justifions cette interpr{\'e}tation au moyen d'une s{\'e}rie d'analyses logistiques de r{\'e}gression, sur les donn{\'e}es du Sondage des {\'e}lections f{\'e}d{\'e}rales canadiennes de 1968, ainsi qu'{\`a} l'aide d'autres sources.},

  abstract = {Abstract Macroeconomic conditions have long been suspected of increasing hostility toward ethnic outgroups. Integrating prior work on macroeconomic threat with recent threat-based models of prejudice, the current work employs an experimental approach to examine the implications of economic threat for prejudice toward ethnic outgroups. In Study 1, participants primed with an economic threat (relative to a non-economic threat and neutral topic) reported more prejudice against Asian Americans, an ethnic group whose stereotype implies a threat to scarce employment opportunities. In addition, economic threat led to a heightened state of anxiety, which mediated the influence of economic threat on prejudice against Asian Americans. Study 2 replicated and extended these findings by demonstrating that economic threat heightened prejudice against Asian Americans, but not Black Americans, an ethnic group whose stereotype does not imply a threat to economic resources. These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for understanding the role of macroeconomic conditions in potentiating antisocial responses to particular outgroups.},

  abstract = {Bisphenol A (BPA) is a monomer used in the manufacture of a multitude of chemical products, including epoxy resins and polycarbonate. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of BPA on male sexual development. This study, performed in CF-1 mice, was limited to the measurement of sex-organ weights, daily sperm production (DSP), epididymal sperm count, and testis histopathology in the offspring of female mice exposed to low doses of BPA (0, 0.2, 2, 20, or 200 microg/kg/day), by deposition in the mouth on gestation days 11-17. Male sexual development determinations were made in offspring at 90 days-of-age. Since this study was conducted to investigate and clarify low-dose effects reported by S. C. Nagel et al., 1997, Environ. Health Perspect. 105, 70-76, and F. S. vom Saal et al., 1998, Toxicol. Indust. Health 14, 239-260, our study protocol purposely duplicated the referenced studies for all factors indicated as critical by those investigators. An additional group was dosed orally with 0.2 microg/kg/day of diethylstilbestrol (DES), which was selected based on the maternal dose reported to have maximum effect on the prostate of developing offspring, by F. S. vom Saal (1996, personal communication), vom Saal et al. (1997, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A 94, 2056-2061). Tocopherol-stripped corn oil was used as the vehicle for BPA and DES, and was administered alone to control animals. No treatment-related effects on clinical observations, body weight, or food consumption were observed in adult females administered any dose of BPA or DES. Similarly, no treatment-related effects on growth or survival of offspring from dams treated with BPA or DES were observed. The total number of pups born per litter was slightly lower in the 200-microg/kg/day BPA group when compared to controls, but this change was not considered treatment-related since the litter size was within the normal range of historical controls. There were no treatment-related effects of BPA or DES on testes histopathology, daily sperm production, or sperm count, or on prostate, preputial gland, seminal vesicle, or epididymis weights at doses previously reported to affect these organs or at doses an order of magnitude higher or lower. In conclusion, under the conditions of this study, the effects of low doses of BPA reported by S. C. Nagel et al., 1997 (see above) and F. S. vom Saal et al., 1998 (see above), or of DES reported by F. S. vom Saal et al., 1997 (see above) were not observed. The absence of adverse findings in the offspring of dams treated orally with DES challenges the "low-dose hypothesis" of a special susceptibility of mammals exposed perinatally to ultra-low doses of even potent estrogenic chemicals. Based on the data in the present study and the considerable body of literature on effects of BPA at similar and much higher doses, BPA should not be considered as a selective reproductive or developmental toxicant.},

In response, democratic institutions are changing, evolving, and expanding in ways that may alter the structure of the democratic process. These changes include reforms of the electoral process, the expansion of referendums, introduction of open government provisions, and more access points for direct political involvement. Indeed, some observers claim that we are witnessing the most fundamental transformation of the democratic process since the creation of mass democracy in the early 20th Century. This international team of distinguished scholars assembles the evidence of how democratic institutions and processes are changing, and considers the larger implications of these reforms for the nature of democracy. The findings points to a new style of democratic politics that expands the nature of democracy, but also carries challenges for democracies to include all its citizens and govern effectively in an environment of complex government.},

Policymakers cannot consider all evidence relevant to policy problems. They use two shortcuts: `rational' ways to gather enough evidence, and `irrational' decision-making, drawing on emotions, beliefs, and habits. Most scientific studies focus on the former. They identify uncertainty when policymakers have incomplete evidence, and try to solve it by improving the supply of information. They do not respond to ambiguity, or the potential for policymakers to understand problems in very different ways. A good strategy requires advocates to be persuasive: forming coalitions with like-minded actors, and accompanying evidence with simple stories to exploit the emotional or ideological biases of policymakers.},

A commercially available drug preparation was tested as a reference. Based on permeation characteristics, a study on the topical and systemic anti-inflammatory activities of three formulations (A, F and the reference formulation) was conducted using the model of erythema induced by UV radiation in hairless rats. This is expected, together with the index of topical anti-inflammatory activity to allow the selection of the most suitable formulation for dermal application. The following representative parameters were measured in the permeation study: amount of diclofenac permeated at 24 h, flow, lag time and amount of drug retained in skill at 24 h. Of the formulations tested, diclofenac formulated in the reference formulation showed the highest values of amount of diclofenac permeated at 24 h. amount of drug retained in skin at 24 and now As regards the skin inflammation test, no significant differences (p {$<$} 0.05) are seen between the topical and systemic anti-inflammatory activities of the three formulations tested. However, in absolute value, formulation F shows a lower systemic activity, which would prevent potential side effects of diclofenac. Since the topical anti-inflammatory index obtained for this formulation was {$>$} 1, it is concluded that a good therapeutic performance could be: obtained in the treatment of local inflammation with diclofenac by using formulation F.},

  abstract = {Leadership is a means by which social groups attempt to realize gains from cooperation, coordination, and efficient allocation. The attempt to achieve such gains gives rise to further, overarching problems of coordination. The latter problems are recurrent but are likely to vary from one situation to the next; this makes decentralized methods of solution especially difficult, and provides the ultimate reason leadership is needed, invented, and accepted. Solution of such overarching problems makes leadership possible in the basic problems in which social gains are available, including activities such as organizing, sanctioning, communicating, and allocating. The stability of leadership is based on the group's need to solve coordination problems; as a result, a leader has discretion or "power," and can get away with less-than-maximal service of group goals. This approach to understanding leadership suggests several useful techniques for the study of political leadership in particular settings.},

This situation has generated problematic impasses, one of which is the emergence of an anti-vaccination movement that is already affecting public health, with a resurgence in the United States of preventable diseases thought to have been eradicated.Drawing on British sociologist Harry Collins' work on expertise, we propose a theoretical framework in which the paralyzing, undue public distrust of science can be analyzed and, it is hoped, overcome.},

Camerer               et al.               found that two-thirds of the 18 studies examined yielded replicable estimates of effect size and direction. This proportion is somewhat lower than unaffiliated experts were willing to bet in an associated prediction market, but roughly in line with expectations from sample sizes and P values.

To contribute data about replicability in economics, we replicated 18 studies published in the               American Economic Review               and the               Quarterly Journal of Economics               between 2011 and 2014. All of these replications followed predefined analysis plans that were made publicly available beforehand, and they all have a statistical power of at least 90\% to detect the original effect size at the 5\% significance level. We found a significant effect in the same direction as in the original study for 11 replications (61\%); on average, the replicated effect size is 66\% of the original. The replicability rate varies between 67\% and 78\% for four additional replicability indicators, including a prediction market measure of peer beliefs.},

The replications are high powered, with sample sizes on average about five times higher than in the original studies. We find a significant effect in the same direction as the original study for 13 (62\%) studies, and the effect size of the replications is on average about 50\% of the original effect size. Replicability varies between 12 (57\%) and 14 (67\%) studies for complementary replicability indicators. Consistent with these results, the estimated true-positive rate is 67\% in a Bayesian analysis. The relative effect size of true positives is estimated to be 71\%, suggesting that both false positives and inflated effect sizes of true positives contribute to imperfect reproducibility. Furthermore, we find that peer beliefs of replicability are strongly related to replicability, suggesting that the research community could predict which results would replicate and that failures to replicate were not the result of chance alone.},

We provide causal evidence that broadcast TV decreased the ideological extremism of US representatives. We then show that exposure to radio was associated with decreased polarization. We interpret this result by using a simple framework that identifies two channels linking media environment to politicians' incentives to polarize. First, the ideology effect: changes in the media environment may affect the distribution of citizens' ideological views, with politicians moving their positions accordingly. Second, the motivation effect: the media may affect citizens' political motivation, changing the ideological composition of the electorate and thereby impacting elite polarization while mass polarization is unchanged. The evidence on polarization and turnout is consistent with a prevalence of the ideology effect in the case of TV, as both of them decreased. Increased turnout associated with radio exposure is in turn consistent with a role for the motivation effect.},

The theory considers factors such as executive competence, challenger quality, and the likelihood that voters will learn the consequences of policy decisions before an upcoming election. We find that an executive who has information suggesting that a popular policy is contrary to voters' interests may or may not pander to voters by choosing it; under certain conditions, the executive can actually increase his probability of reelection by choosing an unpopular policy that is in the public interest. However, we also show that an executive will sometimes face electoral incentives to enact a policy that is both unpopular and contrary to voters' interests. Our theory is illustrated with examples involving President Abraham Lincoln, California Governor Earl Warren, and President Gerald Ford.]},

  abstract = {The objective of this collection of essays is to gain insights into the different national-level state responses to COVID-19 around the world and the conditions that shaped them. The pandemic offers a natural experiment wherein the policy problem governments faced was the same but the responses they made were different, creating opportunities for comparison of both the kinds of policy tools being used and the factors that accounted for their choice. Accordingly, after surveying on-line databases of policy tools used in the pandemic and subjecting these to topic modelling to reveal the characteristics of a `standard' national pandemic response, we discuss the similarities and differences found in specific responses. This is done with reference to the nature and level of policy capacity of respective governments, highlighting the critical roles played by (in)adequate preparation and lesson-drawing from past experi\- ences with similar outbreaks or crises. Taken together the articles show how the national responses to the COVID-19 pandemic were shaped by the opportunity and capacity each government had to learn from previous pandemics and their capacity to operationalize and build political support for the standard portfolio of policy measures deployed to deal with the crisis. However, they also show how other factors such as the nature of national leadership, the organization of government and civil society, and blindspots towards the vulnerabilities of certain population segments also helped to shape policy responses to the pandemic.},

To evaluate the impact of the law we surveyed 410 fast food restaurants in New Jersey and Pennsylvania before and after the rise in the minimum. Comparisons of the changes in wages, employment, and prices at stores in New Jersey relative to stores in Pennsylvania (where the minimum wage remained fixed at \$4.25 per hour) yield simple estimates of the effect of the higher minimum wage. Our empirical findings challenge the prediction that a rise in the minimum reduces employment. Relative to stores in Pennsylvania, fast food restaurants in New Jersey increased employment by 13 percent. We also compare employment growth at stores in New Jersey that were initially paying high wages (and were unaffected by the new law) to employment changes at lower-wage stores. Stores that were unaffected by the minimum wage had the same employment growth as stores in Pennsylvania, while stores that had to increase their wages increased their employment.},

What has been called the ``third wave of democracy'' is driven by the confluence of various trends---the establishment of democracy in countries with no prior democratic experience, its reestablishment in countries that had experienced periods of authoritarian rule, and the expansion in the number of independent states following the demise of European and Soviet communism. A common consequence of these transitions is to focus attention on the constitutional rules that guide competition for and the exercise of political authority under democracy. One of the fundamental aspects of constitutional design is the choice between parliamentary government, presidential government, or a hybrid format that combines some aspects of these two.},

In the United States, authors claim that the white working class offered unprecedented and crucial support for Donald Trump in the 2016 election. But what is the evidence for this claim? We examine all of the available academic survey data gathered around the election, along with a number of surveys from prior elections. We test four common claims about the white working class in 2016: (1) that most Trump voters were white working-class Americans; (2) that most white working-class voters supported Trump; (3) that unusually large numbers of white working-class voters switched from Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016; and (4) that white working-class voters were pivotal to Trump's victory in several swing states. We find that three of the four are not supported by the available data, and the other lacks crucial context that casts doubt on the idea that Trump uniquely appealed to working-class Americans. White working-class Americans have been supporting Republican presidential candidates at higher rates in recent elections, but that process long predates 2016, and narratives that center on Trump's alleged appeal obscure this important long-term trend.},

It outlines a political framework of analysis with which to identify who gains and who loses from social policy. I argue that public policy for older people is a product not only of social structures but also of political decision-making. The Schneider and Ingram (1993) ` target populations ' model is used to investigate how the social construction of groups as dependent equates with lower levels of influence on policy making. In United Kingdom and European research, older people are identified as politically quiescent, but conversely in the United States seniors are viewed as one of the most influential and cohesive interest groups in the political culture. Why are American seniors perceived as politically powerful, while older people in Europe are viewed as dependent and politically weak? This paper applies the `target populations ' model to senior policy in the Republic of Ireland to investigate how theoretical work in the United States may be used to identify the significance of senior power in policy development. I conclude that research must recognise the connections between power, politics and social constructions to investigate how state policies can influence the likelihood that seniors will resist structured dependency using political means.},

Due to its estrogenic properties, exposure to BPA during development could alter the appropriate maturation of pathways essential for normal cognitive function at later ages. To investigate this, the effects of repeated postnatal exposure of male and female rats to BPA on spatial learning and memory were investigated using a Morris water maze. Breeders and offspring were maintained on a standard phytoestrogen-free diet. Oral administration of 72 microg/kg 17 beta-estradiol (E(2)), 100 microg/kg BPA (low BPA), 250 microg/kg BPA (high BPA), or the safflower oil vehicle was performed daily from postnatal d 1 (PND1) through PND14. There were no treatment-related effects on swimming ability or motivation (PND33) or on acquisition of maze solution (PND34-37). However, acquisition of maze performance was significantly better in control males than in control females. Treatment with E(2) and low BPA disrupted this normal gender-dependent pattern of acquisition, while treatment with high BPA did not. In a probe trial (PND40), females treated with high BPA spent significantly less time in the escape quadrant. These data indicate that E(2) and low dosages of BPA can alter the normal gender-dependent pattern of acquisition, while higher dosages of BPA alter the retention of spatial information without significantly affecting acquisition.},

This article provides a theoretically informed and empirically comprehensive analysis of the party politicization of the environment in Britain. Four hypotheses are developed, drawn from the party competition and 'new politics' perspectives, which predict the response of the three major British parties to environmental issues. These hypotheses are tested against a range of quantitative and qualitative sources, notably the Manifesto Research Group and expert survey data. Party politicization of the environment is found to be limited, but there are important variations in party responses. Party competition is critical in explaining these responses. However, the 'new politics' insight that the environmental issue dimension cuts across the traditional left-right cleavage identifies ideology as a further significant constraint on the willingness of established parties to embrace this issue.},

At issue are the sources of declining response rates---declining contact rates, associated mostly with random polling mechanisms, or declining cooperation rates, associated with personal preferences, knowledge, and interest in politics---and their differing effects on measures of polarization. Assessing 158 surveys (2004--2018), we show that declining cooperation is the primary source of declining response rates and that it leads to survey overrepresentation of people who are more engaged in politics. Analyzing individual responses to 1,223 policy questions in those surveys, we further show that, conditional on the policy area, this survey bias overestimates or underestimates the partisan divide among Americans. Our findings question the perceived strength of mass polarization and move forward the discussion about the effect of declining survey response on generalizations from survey data.},

Face sex is particularly relevant for human interactions and face gender recognition is an extremely efficient cognitive process that is acquired early during childhood. To measure the minimum information required for correct gender classification, we have used a pixelation filter and reduced frontal pictures (28,672 pixels) of male and female faces to 7168, 1792, 448 and 112 pixels. We then addressed the following questions: Is gender recognition of male and female faces equally efficient? Are male and female subjects equally efficient at recognising face gender? We found a striking difference in categorisation of male and female faces. Categorisation of female faces reduced to 1792 pixels is at chance level whereas categorisation of male faces is above chance even for 112 pixel images. In addition, the same difference in the efficiency of categorisation of male and female faces was detected using a Gaussian noise filter. A clear sex difference in the efficiency of face gender categorisation was detected as well. Female subject were more efficient in recognising female faces. These results indicate that recognition of male and female faces are different cognitive processes and that in general females are more efficient in this cognitive task.},

We find confirmation for the idea that party positions are linked to factional preferences. Overall, the party works as a `bounded oligarchy'. Furthermore, the electoral payoff of party unity increases the impact of factional constraints when general elections approach. In line with the cartel party theory, however, autonomous leaders who are directly elected by a wider selectorate can get rid of factional ties choosing more moderate and vote-maximizing platforms.},

  publisher = {Routledge},
  abstract = {In 1930, the great Spanish philosopher Jose Ortega y Gasset set forth a program for reforming the modern Spanish university. Aware that the missions of the university are many and often competing, Ortega built his program around a conception of a general culture that knows no national boundaries or time limits and could fit into any national system of higher education. His ideas are especially pertinent to contemporary debate in America over curriculum development and the purpose of education.In this volume Ortega sought to answer two essential questions: what is the knowledge most worth knowing by all students and what is the function of the university in a modern democracy? Basing his answers on his own deep personal culture and an extensive knowledge of the various European university systems, Ortega defined four primary missions: the teaching of the learned professions, the fostering of scientific research, training for political leadership, and finally the creation of cultured persons with the ability to make intellectual interpretations of the world. Ortega's understanding of general culture is set out in great detail here. He meant an active engagement in ideas and issues that were both historical and contemporary. His concern is with the classical problems of justice, the good society, who should rule, and the responsibilities of citizenship.In his informative and brilliant introduction to this new edition, Clark Kerr, a lifetime student of Ortega's work, analyzes Ortega's ideas in their historical context and speculates on how the great issues he dealt with here can be made contemporary for modern students facing the challenges and uncertainties of the twenty-first century. Mission of the University and its new opening essay will be of interest to educationists, social scientists, and above all the students of this era.},

  publisher = {Oxford University Press},

  abstract = {The Challenges of Intra-Party Democracy provides a comprehensive examination of both the concept and the practice of intra-party democracy (IPD). Acknowledging that IPD is now widely viewed, among both democratic practitioners and scholars, as a normative good, this volume suggests that there is no single, or uniformly preferred, form of IPD. Rather, each party's version of IPD results from a series of choices they make relating to the organization and division of power internally. These decisions reflect many variables including a party's democratic ethos, its electoral context, state regulation and whether or not it is in government. Individual chapters examine the relationship between party models and IPD, the decline in party membership and activism, the role of the state in regulating party democracy, issues relating to gender and party organization, norms of candidate and leadership recruitment and selection, party policy development and party finance. The analysis considers the principal issues that parties (and the state) must consider relating to IPD in each area of party activity, the range of options open to them, current trends in terms of paths chosen, what these choices tell us about parties and, most importantly, what the implications of these choices are. In doing so, we offer a common language and set of questions relating to IPD that enhance the ability for consistent evaluation of the state of internal party democracy. Through thorough analysis of associated costs and benefits, we also provide a framework to assist with considerations of IPD reforms -- particularly in terms of their scope, the range of options available and their implications.Comparative Politics is a series for students, teachers, and researchers of political science that deals with contemporary government and politics. Global in scope, books in the series are characterised by a stress on comparative analysis and strong methodological rigour. The series is published in association with the European Consortium for Political Research. For more information visit: www.ecprnet.eu. The Comparative Politics series is edited by Professor David M.

  abstract = {Experimental studies have suggested that unfractionated heparin (UH) has antiinflammatory properties. It is unknown whether UH also has these properties in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Within 12-24 h of treatment onset we measured the acute-phase response as reflected by the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and total number of leukocytes (x10(9)/l) in 706 consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with full-dose UH (n=450), or 300 mg/day aspirin (n=256). Clinical outcome (Mathew scale) at hospital discharge and the effect of factors such as treatment (UH and aspirin), and acute phase response were assessed using multivariate analyses adjusted for baseline confounders and incident complications. Separate models were created for patients with lacunar and nonlacunar stroke. Whereas there were not differences at baseline between the two treatment groups, total leukocyte counts (8.0+/-4.1 vs. 8.6+/-3.2, P{$<$}0.01) and ESR (21.7+/-20.9 vs. 25.2+/-22.9, P{$<$}0.05) were statistically significantly lower in patients treated with UH. This effect of UH was more accentuated in patients with nonlacunar stroke. Overall, leukocytes (7.2+/-2.3 vs. 8.4+/-4.0, P{$<$}0.01), and ESR (15.7+/-17.2 vs. 24.3+/-22.2, P=0.0001) were lower in patients with complete early recovery and this effect was restricted to patients with nonlacunar stroke. Whereas baseline impairment, symptomatic bleeding and stroke recurrence were independent negative outcome predictors, the use of UH was positively associated with early recovery in all patients. This study shows that full-dose UH reduces the acute-phase reaction that follows ischemic stroke more effectively than aspirin. The prognostic implications of such effect seem more notable in patients with nonlacunar stroke. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science BN. All rights reserved.},

We assessed prospectively 39 noncardioembolic stroke patients in which 300 mg/day aspirin had proved effective (n=24) or ineffective (n=15) to prevent recurrent ischemic events. We evaluated platelet aggregation induced by arachidonic acid, adenosine diphosphate and epinephrine, and the sensitivity of platelets to increasing concentrations of the synthetic thromboxane mimetic U46619. Aggregation studies were repeated while subjects received 300 (study phase 1), and 600 (study phase 2) mg/day aspirin, respectively. Overall, arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation was less effectively inhibited during study phase 1 compared to phase 2. Arachidonic acid and epinephrine promoted a stronger platelet aggregation in aspirin nonresponders than in aspirin responders while taking 300 mg/day aspirin. On the other hand, 600 mg/day effectively inhibited platelet function in both clinical groups. A lower sensitivity to thromboxane receptors was also found during phase 1 of the study, although the response was similar between aspirin responders and nonresponders. This pilot study suggests that 300 mg/day aspirin is less effective than 600 mg/day to block the cyclooxygenase pathway in noncardioembolic stroke and, incomplete cyclooxygenase inhibition is associated with recurrent thromboembolic events despite adequate aspirin compliance. It is likely that patients could receive a more efficacious stroke prevention if the dose of aspirin is tailored to individual needs as reflected by laboratory findings.

  abstract = {We document recent changes in Canadian immigration, marked by an increasing prevalence of temporary residency. Using microdata from Statistics Canada's Labour Force Survey, we show that temporary workers' characteristics and nominal wages have diverged from those of Canadian-born workers. Between 2015 and 2024, temporary workers have become younger, less experienced and more likely to migrate from lowerincome countries. As well, the shares of temporary workers in skilled occupations have declined moderately. Throughout this period, the average nominal wage gap between temporary and Canadian-born workers has more than doubled, widening from -9.5\% to -22.6\%. Further, we estimate Mincer regressions to assess how these evolving characteristics have contributed to the growing wage gap. Our findings show that this increase can be explained by observable characteristics. Our results suggest that aggregate nominal wages would have been, on average, 0.7\% higher in 2023--24 had the characteristics of temporary workers remained unchanged over the past decade.},

This study aimed to apply the strategies to promote argumentation among the students in Karachi, Pakistan. The practical action research methodology based on cyclic model by Kemmis et al., (2004) and Toulmin Argument Pattern (TAP) were used to attain the aim of the study. The data were collected from the students of Grade seven and a science teacher through classroom observations, interviews, field notes, reflective journal, audio-recording and document analysis. The data were analyzed in two steps; on-going and overall data analysis. The results revealed that the students could construct better level of arguments by using claim, data and warrant components of TAP, through the whole-class discussion based-on students' personal experiences along with teachers' and students' questioning, and Predict-Observe-Explain (POE) along with working model about the sun, earth and moon. The study recommends that argumentation should be part of all science teacher education programs, science textbooks need to have socio-scientific, health and environmental issues and a persuasive style to develop argumentation which will bring about both conceptual understanding and scientific thinking.},

Our main objective is to determine whether successes of past adopters have the tendency to speed up Twitter adoption, where past success is defined as the average followers per Tweet - a common measure of ``Twitter success'' - among all prior adopters. The data suggests that accelerated adoption can be associated with favorable past outcomes: increasing the average number of followers per Tweet among past adopters by a standard deviation ( of eight followers per Tweet) accelerates the adoption time by about 112 days. This acceleration effect is weaker for those who already have adopted Facebook and those who have access to information about a large number of past adopters. We later find a positive relationship between an adopter's own success and the success of adopters preceding him/her. Thus, there may exist benefits associated with adopting Twitter based on past successes of others. In general, the patterns we find are consistent with predictions generated by a simple model of adoption delay with learning.},

Although the political impact of online citizen expression has drawn considerable attention, research has largely focused on whether and how citizen-generated messages influence the public as an information alternative to traditional news outlets. The present study aims to provide a new perspective on understanding citizen expression by examining its political implications for the expressers themselves rather than those exposed to the expressed ideas. Data from a national survey and an online discussion forum study suggest that expressing oneself about politics provides self-reinforcing feedback. Political expressions on social media and the online forum were found to (a) reinforce the expressers' partisan thought process and (b) harden their pre-existing political preferences. Implications for the role the Internet plays in democracy will be discussed.},

For example, citizens' opinions about a Ku Klux Klan rally may depend on whether elites frame the event as a free-speech issue or a public safety issue. Past research has focused largely on documenting the size of framing effects in uncontested settings. By contrast, there has been little research on framing in competitive environments in which individuals receive multiple frames representing alternative positions on an issue. We take an initial step toward understanding how frames work in competitive environments by integrating research on attitude structure and persuasion. Our theory of framing identifies the key individual and contextual parameters that determine which of many competing frames will have an effect on public opinion.},

How did she emerge from a turbulent childhood to become an inspiring political force? What influences and events have shaped her life? And how is she continuing her quest after losing her partner in life and politics?When she was thirteen, Olivia's middle-class family moved from Hong Kong to Toronto, but the transition was difficult. Her mother went from having a maid to being a maid. Her father failed to carve out a working life for himself in Canada---frustrated and bitter, he lashed out at Olivia's mother and violence darkened their lives. A rebellious yet playful child, Olivia discovered self-discipline and became an excellent student in Canada, studying fine art and philosophy at university. After graduating, Olivia worked for a time as a sculptor. Then, driven by a desire to achieve social change, the artist became an activist, and she launched her political career.As a popular and much-admired school trustee and Toronto city councillor---the first Asian woman in that role---Olivia honed a grassroots approach and crafted progressive programs that enhanced the lives of others, especially children. Strong-willed, focused and passionate, Olivia got things done by bringing together people from all parts of the political spectrum.In the mid-1980s, Olivia met Jack Layton. Their dynamic partnership, unprecedented in Canadian political life, made a powerful impact in Toronto, and on the national stage. Together, they forged a strong vision for a better country and for enlightened political change. But when her beloved partner and political soulmate died in the summer of 2011, how did she find the strength to move forward? What might we learn from her inspiring story? Those answers are here, in Olivia: My Canadian Journey.},

  abstract = {In contrast to the federal government, some US states have taken an aggressive approach to curbing climate change. They use a variety of policy instruments to reduce greenhouse gases. These instruments can be categorized into two broad categories: economic incentives and command-and-control regulation. While the use of economic incentives has, on average, increased, some states employ them more than others. This article compares the propensity of different US states to employ economic incentives in the area of climate change. For this purpose, it analyses and tests four models: (i) a needs/responsiveness model, (ii) an interest group influence model, (iii) an innovation-and-diffusion model, and (iv) a combined model. Interestingly, this article finds that economic incentives are pushed out of the political agenda when states are confronted with a more severe problem in terms of carbon emissions and dependence on conventional energy. This article also finds support for the traditional, antagonistic view of 'industry versus environmentalists': electric utility companies tend to oppose economic incentives, while environmentalists and renewable energy producers tend to support them.},

This restricted role of economic motives rooted in one's personal circumstances held true across ethnic groups, among residents in communities with different numbers of foreign-born, and in both 1992 and 1994.},

Employing data gathered in a national panel survey conducted before and after the referendum, analyses document that economic- and immigration-focused benefit-cost evaluations strongly influenced voters' decisions. Risk assessments, emotional reactions to EU membership and leader image heuristics were other major proximate forces driving the choices voters made. National identities were influential as well, but operated further back in the set of forces affecting attitudes towards the EU. The June 23rd Brexit decision thus reflected a diverse mix of calculations, emotions and cues. Given the close division of the vote, it is plausible that a substantial change in any of these factors could have changed the referendum outcome.},

  abstract = {The relationships amongst the health professions and between them and the state are rapidly changing. I argue that analysis of these relationships has to take into consideration: the fact that medicine played an intermediary role (through medical dominance in health care) between the state and the other health occupations; the permeability of the boundaries of the state and the professions; and the dual nature of professional organizations (as sites of intra-occupational conflict and as possible vehicles of extra-occupational control). In Ontario the medical profession partially `mediated' the relationships between `non-physician' health occupations and the state through medical control over other health care occupations. National/provincial health insurance brought the state into the health care system as an actor and forced a reconsideration of its relationships with medicine and with the other health care occupations. The state came to be directly involved in `rationalizing' health care. This involvement meant curbing the power of medicine and modifying the relationships between medicine and the para-medical occupations. State influence is partly constructed through a particular kind of professional organization, namely, the professional College. These changing relationships are illustrated by historical and recent developments regarding medicine, nursing and chiropractic in Ontario.},

The country has changed a great deal over these past decades; however, Canada's political institutions have not. The relative stability of political institutions in the face of rapidly changing social, economic, and international environments is an enduring theme of Canadian politics.  With the most recent election, the federal government laid out an ambitious agenda of political reform. Among other changes, the new government has pledged to reform the House of Commons, the senate, and the way votes are counted and seats are allocated in elections. This text provides readers with the tools and background knowledge to help them think seriously and critically about these and many other questions that Canada now faces.  This text places its major focus between the two parts of the Canadian political system: its ``environment'' and its institutions.  Students will be deeply engaged in the clash of interests from which Canadian political activity has stemmed, and will be equally fascinated by topics related to political culture, the mass media, public opinion, elections, and advocacy groups that will introduce them to the vibrant and dynamic world of Canadian politics.   This new eighth edition of Canadian Politics: Critical Approaches seeks to make informed critics of its readers by presenting the relevant, challenging concepts of Canada's political system with a balanced and engaging account of both political institutions and social influencers.},

The central hypothesis is that ideological disagreement between the left and the right is asymmetrical, that is, that leftists and rightists bundle in different ways their opinions about issues. The analysis draws on evidence from Benoit and Laver's survey of experts {\textasciitilde}2006! about the policy positions of political parties, the Comparative Manifesto Research Project {\textasciitilde}Budge et al., 2001; Klingemann et al., 2006!, and Cross and Young's survey of Canadian political party members {\textasciitilde}2002!.

  abstract = {This article contests the concepts of "region" and "regionalism" in Canadian political science. There is widespread agreement among observers of politics in Canada that the country is divided in politically consequential ways along regional lines. There is little agreement, however, about what causes these regional divisions or, indeed, about where the lines of regional division should be drawn. As a result, rival explanations for regional differences in Canada are commonly tested against different evidence arising from different definitions of region. This article argues that "region" should be conceptualized in generalizable terms as the physical space that surrounds an individual, and that "regionalism" should be conceptualized as an affective attachment to the people, places and institutions within a geographic area. Regionalism, from this perspective, is a concept that plays an important role in driving regional differences in opinion differences rather than simply describing these differences. The article applies this argument to a study of regional differences in Canadian opinions about government involvement in the economy. The empirical analysis points to the need for the development of concepts that can be generalized across explanations and levels of analysis. Even on the single issue analyzed here, regional differences appeared to have different causes in different regions, and these different causes seemed to operate at different levels of analysis. Cet article questionne le bien-fond{\'e} des concepts de "r{\'e}gion" et de "r{\'e}gionalisme" tels qu'utilis{\'e}s dans la litt{\'e}rature en science politique au Canada. La plupart des politologues s'entendent pour souligner l'importance des clivages r{\'e}gionaux dans la politique canadienne. Par contre, on s'entend moins sur l'identification des sources de ces divisions r{\'e}gionales, ainsi que sur la d{\'e}limitation de ces diff{\'e}rentes r{\'e}gions. Par cons{\'e}quent, les {\'e}tudes scientifiques des facteurs possibles qui sous-tendent les clivages r{\'e}gionaux sont souvent difficile a compar{\'e} puisqu'elles utilisent diff{\'e}rentes d{\'e}finitions du concept de "r{\'e}gion". Cet article d{\'e}fend l'id{\'e}e que le concept de "r{\'e}gion" devrait {\^e}tre limit{\'e} {\`a} d{\'e}crire l'espace physique o{\`u} se situe un individu. Par ailleurs le concept de "r{\'e}gionalisme" devrait inclure l'id{\'e}e d'un attachement affectif aux personnes, endroits et institutions d'un emplacement g{\'e}ographique donn{\'e}. Le r{\'e}gionalisme, dans cette perspective, doit {\^e}tre compris comme une cause des clivages r{\'e}gionaux, et non comme une simple description de ces diff{\'e}rences. Cet article propose l'utilisation de cette distinction conceptuelle {\`a} une {\'e}tude des diff{\'e}rences r{\'e}gionales quant {\`a} l'opinion publique sur le r{\^o}le que devrait avoir le gouvernement dans l'{\'e}conomie. L'analyse empirique d{\'e}montre l'importance de d{\'e}velopper des concepts qui peuvent {\^e}tre g{\'e}n{\'e}ralis{\'e}s au point de s'appliquer {\`a} diff{\'e}rentes explications et niveaux d'analyse. Si on se fie au seul enjeu {\'e}tudi{\'e} dans cet article, les clivages r{\'e}gionaux semblent avoir diff{\'e}rentes causes dans chacune des r{\'e}gions, et ces causes semblent op{\'e}rer {\`a} diff{\'e}rents niveaux d'analyse.},

  abstract = {Problems of housing affordability have been afflicting parts of the UK, especially the South East of England, for a number of years. The problem is closely related to shortages in housing supply, which are, in turn, largely associated with constraints imposed by the English land planning system. A leading theory for explaining these constraints posits that they reflect political economy forces that convey the interests of current homeowners to planning decisions in disproportionate and excessively influential ways. We test this theory by examining survey data on public attitudes to house building in local communities; and by investigating whether these attitudes are related to local planning decisions. We find that there is a tendency for owner-occupiers to express greater opposition to local house building and that, in the decade to 2011, the housing stock grew significantly less in local authorities with higher proportions of owner-occupiers among local households. The results suggest the risk that planning decisions might have been distorted in favour of current homeowners is real and economically significant. We discuss a range of historical, socio-economic and policy trends that help explain why successive governments of various stripes have been reluctant to address head-on problems in housing supply and put a curb on house prices.},

  abstract = {Introduction               The gender gap in populist radical right voting---with women being less likely to support populist radical right parties than men---is well-established. Much less is known about the interplay between gender, masculinity and populist radical right voting. This study investigates the extent to which masculinity affects women and men's likelihood of supporting populist radical right parties. Focusing on sexism as a link between masculinity and populist radical right support, we put forward two mechanisms that operate at once: a mediating effect of sexism (sexism explains the association between masculinity and populist radical right voting) and a moderating effect of sexism (the impact of masculinity is stronger among citizens scoring high on sexism compared with citizens with low levels of sexist attitudes).                                         Methods               We draw on an original dataset collected in Spain at the end of 2020 to investigate support for the Spanish populist radical right party VOX.                                         Results               We find support for hypothesized mechanisms, mediation and moderation, chiefly among men. First, sexism explains about half of the link between masculinity and populist radical right support for this group, confirming the hypothesized mediation effect. Second, masculinity has a significantly stronger impact on the likelihood of supporting VOX among men scoring high on sexism, which in turn substantiates the presence of a moderation effect.                                         Discussion               Existing research so far has examined the empirical connections between how individuals perceive their levels of masculinity, sexism, and PRR voting separately. Our study offers a first step in unpacking the relationship between masculinity and PRR support by focusing specifically on how sexism relates to both these variables.},

Our evidence in some respects supports Carry's assertion that Canadian parties are stratarchically organized, but it also suggests that changes to the regulatory regime governing political finance have contributed to a centralization of power at the level of the national party and at the expense of candidates and local associations. This centralizing tendency is significant, as it may disrupt the bargain that underlies the stratarchical organization of Canadian parties. {\`A} la lumi{\`e}re d'une revue des constitutions et de divers autres documents des partis politiques canadiens, ces derniers ont {\'e}t{\'e} d{\'e}crits comme {\'e}tant organis{\'e}s de mani{\`e}re stratarchique (Carty, 2002). Nous d{\'e}gageons quatre mod{\`e}les de flux mon{\'e}taires internes des partis qui correspondent {\`a} diff{\'e}rents mod{\`e}les d'organisation interne des partis politiques. Nous retra{\c c}ons les entr{\'e}es de fonds des quatre principaux partis politiques canadiens et leur distribution interne de 2004 {\`a} 2007 en vue d'identifier le mod{\`e}le d'organisation de parti qui correspond {\`a} ces flux mon{\'e}taires. Sous certains rapports, nos r{\'e}sultats appuient l'argument de Carty affirmant que les partis canadiens sont organis{\'e}s de mani{\`e}re stratarchique, mais ils sugg{\`e}rent aussi que les changements apport{\'e}s au r{\'e}gime r{\'e}gulateur gouvernant le financement politique ont contribu{\'e} {\`a} une centralisation du pouvoir au niveau national des partis et ce aux d{\'e}pens des candidats et des associations locales. Cette tendance centralisatrice est importante, car elle peut rompre le compromis qui sous-tend l'organisation stratarchique des partis politiques canadiens.},

The structures of Plymouth HAZ are assessed in the context of horizontal, vertical and downward models of accountability. The study finds fundamental weaknesses in the accountability regime. Vertical mechanisms are superficial and often inappropriate. The impact of horizontal accountability is marginalised through factors such as informal networks of dependency and a culture that discourages rigorous scrutiny. Downward accountability is addressed through the dissemination of information about achievements. In particular, the study highlights the difficulties of relying on local partners as the main mechanism of accountability. Plymouth HAZ is also evaluated in relation to political marketing and found to possess a sales-orientation.},

While there has been long-standing evidence that people are sensitive to the characteristics of the sources of testimony, for example in the context of persuasion, researchers have only recently begun to explore the wider implications of source reliability considerations for the nature of our beliefs. Likewise, much remains to be established concerning what factors influence source reliability. In this paper, we examine, both theoretically and empirically, the implications of using message content as a cue to source reliability. We present a set of experiments examining the relationship between source information and message content in people's responses to simple communications. The results show that people spontaneously revise their beliefs in the reliability of the source on the basis of the expectedness of a source's claim and, conversely, adjust message impact by perceived reliability; hence source reliability and message content have a bi-directional relationship. The implications are discussed for a variety of psychological, philosophical and political issues such as belief polarization and dual-route models of persuasion.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

After intravenous administration cyanamide displayed a disposition profile according to a two-compartmental open model. Elimination half-life and total plasma clearance values ranged from 42.2 to 61.3 and from 0.0123 to 0.0190 L.kg(-1).min(-1), respectively.

To date, most scholarly studies of the phenomenon have focused on its features and consequences in advanced democracies. This study expands the analysis of the permanent campaign by examining its relationship to the rise of an extreme version of the plebiscitary presidency in the Andean region of Latin America. Through an examination of the administration of Rafael Correa in Ecuador, we show how the permanent campaign has been used as part of a strategy to secure the president's stay in office and effect far-reaching constitutional change. In countries where mechanisms of accountability are already weak, we conclude that conjoining of the plebiscitary presidency and the permanent campaign is likely to exacerbate the accountability deficit and generate problematic consequences for democratic political development.},

We examine two networks of political communication on Twitter, comprised of more than 250,000 tweets from the six weeks leading up to the 2010 U.S. congressional midterm elections. Using a combination of network clustering algorithms and manually-annotated data we demonstrate that the network of political retweets exhibits a highly segregated partisan structure, with extremely limited connectivity between left- and right-leaning users. Surprisingly this is not the case for the user-to-user mention network, which is dominated by a single politically heterogeneous cluster of users in which ideologically-opposed individuals interact at a much higher rate compared to the network of retweets. To explain the distinct topologies of the retweet and mention networks we conjecture that politically motivated individuals provoke interaction by injecting partisan content into information streams whose primary audience consists of ideologically-opposed users. We conclude with statistical evidence in support of this hypothesis.},

Then I address the degree to which there may be some long-term secular change in the parameters that I originally laid out. In the final section, I provide a case study of public understanding of factual trends in federal tax policy in recent decades which seems commendably veridical on average. The preferences of the public thereon add up to a remarkably clear popular mandate. But this mandate seems to disappear rather magically in the voting booth, probably due to a combination of limited contextual information on the public side, and considerable skill on the elite side in manipulating apparent political realities.},

Merchants of Doubt tells the story of how a loose-knit group of high-level scientists and scientific advisers, with deep connections in politics and industry, ran effective campaigns to mislead the public and deny well-established scientific knowledge over four decades. Remarkably, the same individuals surface repeatedly-some of the same figures who have claimed that the science of global warming is "not settled" denied the truth of studies linking smoking to lung cancer, coal smoke to acid rain, and CFCs to the ozone hole.

L'{\'e}mergence des mouvements de fermiers, leur irruption sur la sc{\`e}ne politique, la mont{\'e}e et la chute du {$<<$} Progressive party {$>>$}, et la naissance subs{\'e}quente de la Ligue du cr{\'e}dit social en Alberta et de la CCF en Saskatchewan, ont {\'e}t{\'e} parmi les ph{\'e}nom{\`e}nes les plus {\'e}tudi{\'e}s dans l'historiographie sociale canadienne. N{\'e}anmoins aucune perspective th{\'e}orique viable pour analyser et expliquer de tels ph{\'e}nom{\`e}nes n' a {\'e}t{\'e} produite par la sociologie politique canadienne. Toutes les {\'e}tudes existantes ont {\'e}t{\'e} faites {\`a} partir de cadres th{\'e}oriques diff{\'e}rentes sans concept unificateur. La plupart des travaux en ce domaine ont minimis{\'e} le concept de {$<<$} populisme {$>>$} qui a pourtant servi de base aux {\'e}tudes sur des mouvements similaires aux Etats-Unis et en Europe. Il y a longtemps d{\'e}j{\`a} que les sp{\'e}cialistes canadiens des sciences sociales auraient d{\^u} entreprendre une application syst{\'e}matique du mod{\`e}le th{\'e}orique li{\'e} au concept de {$<<$} populisme {$>>$} aux mouvements des fermiers, au {$<<$} Progressive party {$>>$}, au Cr{\'e}dit social et {\`a} la CCF. La pr{\'e}sente {\'e}tude entame ce projet par une analyse critique de ce concept, utilis{\'e} par les sp{\'e}cialistes am{\'e}ricains et europ{\'e}ens. L'auteur en arrive {\`a} conclure que les travaux de L{\'e}nine sont ceux qui pr{\'e}sentent la meilleure perspective th{\'e}orique de ce concept. Il sugg{\`e}re aussi que cette th{\'e}orie fournit non seulement les lin{\'e}aments pour une r{\'e}vision syst{\'e}matique des recherches effectu{\'e}es par les sp{\'e}cialistes canadiens mais qu'en plus elle ouvre de nouvelles pistes de recherches. L'auteur propose qu'une telle r{\'e}vision prenne pour point de d{\'e}part les r{\'e}alisations des actuels gouvernements du Cr{\'e}dit social en Alberta et de la CCF en Saskatchewan plut{\^o}t que la rh{\'e}torique employ{\'e}e par chacun de ces mouvements. Une telle base objective permettra d'apporter une r{\'e}ponse d{\'e}finitive {\`a} la question suivante: {$<<$} Pouvons-nous mieux comprendre la CCF et le Cr{\'e}dit social si nous les analysons en tant que r{\'e}actions populistes {\`a} la forme qu'a prise le capitalisme industriel au Canada? {$>>$}},

The elicitation, representation, and use of expert opinion is increasingly important for two reasons: advancing technology leads to more and more complex decision problems, and technologists are turning in greater numbers to "expert systems" and other similar artifacts of artificial intelligence. Cooke here considers how expert opinion is being used today, how an expert's uncertainty is or should be represented, how people do or should reason with uncertainty, how the quality and usefulness of expert opinion can be assessed, and how the views of several experts might be combined. He argues for the importance of developing practical models with a transparent mathematic foundation for the use of expert opinion in science, and presents three tested models, termed "classical," "Bayesian," and "psychological scaling." Detailed case studies illustrate how they can be applied to a diversity of real problems in engineering and planning.},

  abstract = {This paper critically analyzes the survey literature on trust in government and confidence in institutions. It highlights the gap between theoretical understandings of trust which encompass trust, lack of trust, and distrust, next to empirical realizations which fail to consider active distrust of government. Using a specially tailored survey designed for this project, the paper is the first which directly compares competing operationalizations of trust and distrust. The most frequently used measures, both from the National Election Studies and the General Social Survey, tend to exaggerate the level of disaffection compared to a new measure especially designed to run from active trust, which anticipates that the government will do the right thing, to active distrust, the expectation that it will do the wrong thing. Multivariate analyses reveal statistically significant differences in the underlying determinants of these measures. The conventional NES measure in particular is more influenced by short-term evaluations of political events and leaders; our new measure of active trust/distrust taps a more deeply seated orientation toward government.},

One commonly offered explanation for these small effects is heterogeneity: Persuasion may only work well in specific circumstances. To evaluate heterogeneity, we repeated an experiment weekly in real time using 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign advertisements. We tested 49 political advertisements in 59 unique experiments on 34,000 people. We investigate heterogeneous effects by sender (candidates or groups), receiver (subject partisanship), content (attack or promotional), and context (battleground versus non-battleground, primary versus general election, and early versus late). We find small average effects on candidate favorability and vote. These small effects, however, do not mask substantial heterogeneity even where theory from political science suggests that we should find it. During the primary and general election, in battleground states, for Democrats, Republicans, and Independents, effects are similarly small. Heterogeneity with large offsetting effects is not the source of small average effects.},

The questions guiding this research are how popular were online campaigns in terms of candidate use of Web sites and which trust and credibility-building Web site design cues were leveraged by candidates. This study also explored differences in online campaign practices both between Greek political parties and between the 2007 national Greek elections and the 2002 federal US elections. The entire population of Greek candidates' Web sites (n = 373) was reviewed and evaluated against a framework that consisted of 58 Web site design features reflecting the potential of Web technologies for political marketing. Results indicate that only 18\% of Greek candidates had a Web presence in 2007, and on average these online campaigns were quite limited in their implementations of practices such as volunteer recruitment, fundraising, and Web-exclusive activities. On average, these implementations led in certain areas, but more interestingly lagged the US in online political marketing activities such as the provision of electronic paraphernalia, a campaign calendar, a privacy policy, issues statements. and endorsements. Twenty-four Web site design features are recommended for candidates to remain at par within the online political marketing scene in Greece. Findings are complemented by two case studies of Web sites that demonstrate mature use of Web technologies in online political campaigning. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

"Tripartism" is an ideology based upon a dominant historical tendency, namely the emergence of a corporative form of state in both developed and underdeveloped countries. The AFL-CIO has participated in the construction of the corporative state in the US and has supported its hegemonic role in the world in concert with American business interests and the CIA. Neither the ILO nor international trade union organizations (especially the ICFTU) has enjoyed a stable relationship with the center of hegemonic power in the labor field, since the AFL-CIO has conducted a unilateral foreign policy. The functionalist strategy of executive leadership asserting the autonomy of an international organization through task expansion in technical fields has been almost totally irrelevant to the issue. Nor has the ILO found an alternative counter-hegemonic base of support, e.g., in the Third World. The existing hegemony has reasserted itself through the ILO program and ideology even as the US has withdrawn material support. Hegemony, which no longer operates through majority votes in international organizations, works instead through bureaucratic controls. This structure of power has prevented the ILO from confronting effectively the real social issues of employment-creation, land reform, marginality, and poverty in general. Initiatives that have been taken to deal with such issues have all ultimately been diverted into programs consistent with the hegemonic ideology and power relations.},

The policy advisory system in Anglophone countries is composed of different types of advisers who have input into government decision making. Government choices about who advises them varies widely as they demand contestability, greater partisan input and more external consultation. The professional advice of the public service may be disregarded. The consequences for public policy are immense depending on whether a plurality of advice works effectively or is derailed by narrow and partisan agendas that lack an evidence base and implementation plans. The book seeks to addresses these issues within a comparative country analysis of how policy advisory systems are constituted and how they operate in the age of instability in governance and major challenges with how the complexity policy issue can be handled.},

  abstract = {The rise of the critical blogosphere has challenged the authority of the mainstream media while sparking discussion concerning the proper relationship between news production and popular democracy in an Internet Age. All too often, however, this discussion is framed as a stark tension between aristocratic defenders of Old Media professionalism and democratic proponents of New Media egalitarianism. Lost in this framing is the tacit agreement, by both sides, that a solution must be found within the constraints of a corporate liberal media structure. This essay argues that if we are to make full use of the opportunities presented to us by new technologies, we must move beyond the discourse of corporate liberalism. Toward this end, I return to the philosophical debate between John Dewey and Walter Lippmann that occurred in the early part of the twentieth century. Based both on their shared principles and their points of departure, I argue that any productive discussion about democratic media reform must begin on the premise that we must supplement the current communication practices of corporate liberalism with noncommercial agencies of cooperative social inquiry and artistic news production. For both Dewey and Lippmann, only through creative investment of public resources can we facilitate intelligent and sympathetic collective judgment in a complex global environment. Their debate concerned only how and where to invest them.},

  abstract = {The Challenges of Intra-Party Democracy provides a comprehensive examination of both the concept and the practice of intra-party democracy (IPD). Acknowledging that IPD is now widely viewed, among both democratic practitioners and scholars, as a normative good, this volume suggests that there is no single, or uniformly preferred, form of IPD. Rather, each party's version of IPD results from a series of choices they make relating to the organization and division of power internally. These decisions reflect many variables including a party's democratic ethos, its electoral context, state regulation and whether or not it is in government. Individual chapters examine the relationship between party models and IPD, the decline in party membership and activism, the role of the state in regulating party democracy, issues relating to gender and party organization, norms of candidate and leadership recruitment and selection, party policy development and party finance. The analysis considers the principal issues that parties (and the state) must consider relating to IPD in each area of party activity, the range of options open to them, current trends in terms of paths chosen, what these choices tell us about parties and, most importantly, what the implications of these choices are. In doing so, we offer a common language and set of questions relating to IPD that enhance the ability for consistent evaluation of the state of internal party democracy. Through thorough analysis of associated costs and benefits, we also provide a framework to assist with considerations of IPD reforms --- particularly in terms of their scope, the range of options available and their implications. Comparative Politics is a series for students, teachers, and researchers of political science that deals with contemporary government and politics. Global in scope, books in the series are characterised by a stress on comparative analysis and strong methodological rigour.

Data from a survey of members of the five major federal parties demonstrate that few Canadians belong to political parties, and those who do belong are not representative of voters generally. The findings also suggest that members are primarily engaged in low-intensity activity and generally contribute little time to party affairs. We conclude that the parties' inability to engage a significant number of voters as members, particularly younger Canadians, presents an ongoing challenge to their vitality as democratic institutions.}

  abstract = {Recent literature has renewed interest in the stratarchical model of intraparty decision-making. In this version of party organization, the functions performed by parties are distributed among their discrete levels. The result is a power-sharing arrangement in which no group has control over all aspects of party life. Thus, the model potentially provides an antidote to the hierarchical version of organization. This article examines the principal parties in Australia, Canada, Ireland and New Zealand to test whether there is empirical evidence of stratarchy. An examination of candidate nomination, leadership selection and policy development finds strong evidence of shared authority between both levels of the party in key areas of intraparty democracy. Both levels accept that they cannot achieve their goals without the support of the other and so a fine balancing act ensues, resulting in constant recalibration of power relations. There is, however, little evidence of the commonly presented model of stratarchy as mutual autonomy for each level within discrete areas of competency. Instead, both the party on the ground and in the centre share authority within all three areas, resulting in a pattern of mutual interdependence rather than mutual autonomy.},

Theoreticians have suggested several mechanisms to explain this ubiquitous phenomenon, including reciprocity, reputation, and punishment, but the problem is still unsolved. Here we show, through experiments conducted with groups of people playing an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma on a dynamic network, that it is reputation what really fosters cooperation. While this mechanism has already been observed in unstructured populations, we find that it acts equally when interactions are given by a network that players can reconfigure dynamically. Furthermore, our observations reveal that memory also drives the network formation process, and cooperators assort more, with longer link lifetimes, the longer the past actions record. Our analysis demonstrates, for the first time, that reputation can be very well quantified as a weighted mean of the fractions of past cooperative acts and the last action performed. This finding has potential applications in collaborative systems and e-commerce.},

  abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to reinterpret and test empirically Newman's model of voter's choice behavior, where three elements influencing the choice of a given candidate were included: the media's role in the election; cognitive reasons to vote for; and emotional feelings toward the candidate. Design/methodology/approach - The data from Polish and US 2000 presidential elections have been analyzed and compared. The research purpose is concerned with the measurement of the model's seven domains of political object evaluation (issues and policies, emotional feelings, candidate image, current events, social imagery and epistemic issues), and its `predictive power for the choice of a presidential candidate. The data are analyzed using the methodology of structural equations modeling, and are interpreted with the terms of mutual causal relationships between these domains. Findings - The key factor in influencing voting behavior is evoking positive emotions towards the candidate and then providing voters with a justification for such affect. However, this is especially applicable in an evolving democracy like Poland. In an established democracy like the USA, voters have already learned to more carefully analyze messages from presidential campaigns and they are more resistant to the unconscious power of affect. Furthermore, in the case of challengers, the media exerts a stronger influence on the valuation of their candidacies, but for incumbents, the role of the media is not so pervasive. Research limitations/implications - The main limitation of the results of this study is the non-representative character of the samples used and its size. Research should be carried out on a representative sample as the next step toward a complete verification of the voter behavior model. Practical implications - The reported results make it possible to elaborate more precisely and effectively strategies to segment voters and position candidates in the minds of voters. Political consultants can use the level of electorate cognitive stability to accurately control the media in political campaigns for their candidate. Originality/value - The paper presents an interdisciplinary and cross-cultural approach to analyzing and understanding voter behavior. It offers a baseline to carry out research in disciplines pertinent to political marketing, communication, and psychology.},

  abstract = {'We are neither Left nor Right, we are out in front' was the mantra of the environmental movement in the 1970s and early 1980s. This research examines the relationship between the traditional left/right economic cleavage and the environmental cleavage in structuring party competition in advanced industrial democracies. It begins by discussing the theoretical rationale for the separation of environmentalism from the traditional economic cleavage, and utilises new expert data to describe the evolution of party positions between 1989 and 2002-2003. An initially strong relationship between party positions on both dimensions in 1989 has strengthened over time. The convergence occurs largely because of changes by Green parties and by the addition of new parties that define themselves on both dimensions. This points to the ability of democratic party systems to integrate a new political cleavage, and the process of integration. However, leftist parties still continue to diverge with respect to how they respond to the environmental cleavage.},

Do factors such as generations, sex, attitudes towards Qu{\'e}bec sovereignty and party identification have the same weight in voters' calculus over time? Our results show a relative stability, but also several interesting variations, especially regarding the effect of support for Qu{\'e}bec independence.

  abstract = {This study examined the impact on a course evaluation of the course being either an elective or a required part of a training programme. Three elective and three required courses were evaluated using both a scaled and an open-ended response form. Many variables were taken into account when examining the effect of course status which other researchers have tended to neglect. These included the type of training method employed, the presenter and the type of student. It was found using a scaled response form that the elective courses received more favourable responses than the required courses on all three measures used, while on the open-ended response forms this occurred for two of the measures. It is suggested that when comparing course evaluations care should be taken to ensure that the status of the course as elective or required is taken into account.},

It is concluded that there is a referendum dynamic capable of anticipating the diverse fluoridation votes of the 1950s, the ERA campaigns of the 1970s, and the Irish divorce vote of 1986, all of which displayed large voter shifts from an initial majority in favor to an eventual majority against. The dynamic process involved appears to be a pattern of elite retreat brought about by community conflict, rather than the result of confusion, ignorance, a herd instinct, or alienation in the electorate.},

We argue that the decline of local newspapers has contributed to the nationalization of American politics: as local newspapers close, Americans rely more heavily on available national news or partisan heuristics to make political decisions. We assess the impact of newspaper closures on polarized voting, using genetic matching to compare counties that are statistically similar but for the loss of a local newspaper. We identify a small but significant causal decrease in split-ticket voting in presidential and senatorial elections in these matched communities: in areas where a newspaper closed, split-ticket voting decreased by 1.9\%.},

  abstract = {We could see this, for example, in the communities across the country which passed unilingual municipal laws. We saw a rejection of some aspects of bilingualism in the Spicer Commission. We also saw this change in hardening attitudes towards immigration: attitudes toward immigrants became more negative in the early 1990s. Canadians didn't start feeling more secure until relatively recently. Even though the recession itself was confined to the early 1990s, feelings of insecurity lasted until late in the decade. We can see this when we look at some survey data. Environics has been asking Canadians about their awareness of multicultural policy since 1976, in the question "Is there a federal policy of multiculturalism?" (Figure 1) We saw awareness growing until the 1990s, when it fell. It started to pick up at the end of the 90s, and in 2002, we see that the vast majority of Canadians - 79\% in this survey - tell us that, in fact, there is a policy of multiculturalism. So we saw an increase in awareness, then a decline during the 90s, followed by an increase in this new decade. {$<$}/para{$><$}para{$>$}We can see a positive trend when we look at the responses over time to a number of questions about the effects of a policy of multiculturalism (Table 1). For virtually every aspect of multiculturalism, Canadians have become more favourable over the 1989-2002 time period. We have other survey data which show that Canadians think bilingualism and multiculturalism are important for the Canadian identity. In my opinion, this is further evidence that Canadians support these institutions. But we have also seen from our surveys how opinions can change, and how larger events outside of the area of language and ethnic diversity can impact and affect attitudes and public acceptance. When the economy declines, when our larger institutions are being threatened, and when Canadians themselves feel threatened, we see that support for diversity can be challenged. Thus, one of the challenges for our country is to keep the larger institutions strong and stable. Bilingualism and multiculturalism cannot rely on our social values alone, regardless of how supportive these values may be. We also need a strong economy and institutions that support equality of opportunity.},

Little attention has been devoted to validating the responses to his postmaterialist-materialist index. The aggregate-level distributions may appear to reflect a postmaterialist-materialist dimension, even if at the individual level responses on the questions making up the index are random. The logic of the survey questions used for the index defines a baseline against which the actual distribution of responses can be compared. Using such a standard, we find that individual responses are not constrained by an underlying value dimension, in the sense that the observed patterns of responses increasingly do not differ from what one would expect by chance. Furthermore, as one would expect for a random variable, index scores are virtually unexplainable as a dependent variable, and they cannot be used to predict support for various political and social issues, said to flow from attitudes measured by the index.},

Empirical analysis first establishes the critical and distinct roles played by economic and cultural concerns over immigration in determining citizen's rightward ideology and voting for rightwing parties. Second, we investigate the determinants of economic and cultural concerns over immigration, finding strong and consistent evidence for the salience hypothesis, which suggests that immigrant share of a country's population shapes citizen concerns over immigration. Thereafter, we document the roles of macro-level economic and cultural channels in determining the strength of salience effects. Finally, we investigate how the characteristics of the immigrant population affect native concerns over immigration.},

Instead, evidence presented here observes that a major function of news media is to act as a communications forum for elites in their daily conflicts and negotiations. With elites acting as sources, targets and major recipients of news texts, inter-elite, rather than elite-mass, communications seems to be a key feature of the political process. These findings are based on a series of 98 semi-structured interviews with political and corporate news sources, and senior journalists in the UK.},

His theories have helped change the whole nature of the study of social biology, and have forced thousands of readers to rethink their beliefs about life. In his internationally bestselling, now classic volume, The Selfish Gene, Dawkins explains how the selfish gene can also be a subtle gene. The world of the selfish gene revolves around savage competition, ruthless exploitation, and deceit, and yet, Dawkins argues, acts of apparent altruism do exist in nature. Bees, for example, will commit suicide when they sting to protect the hive, and birds will risk their lives to warn the flock of an approaching hawk. This revised edition of Dawkins' fascinating book contains two new chapters. One, entitled "Nice Guys Finish First," demonstrates how cooperation can evolve even in a basically selfish world. The other new chapter, entitled "The Long Reach of the Gene," which reflects the arguments presented in Dawkins' The Extended Phenotype, clarifies the startling view that genes may reach outside the bodies in which they dwell and manipulate other individuals and even the world at large. Containing a wealth of remarkable new insights into the biological world, the second edition once again drives home the fact that truth is stranger than fiction.},

Method: The current study endeavored to estimate the prevalence of individuals identifying as transgender in a large online sample of adult U.S. residents (n = 6,727) and compare the prevalence of common mental health disorders (depression, anxiety, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) and the age of onset for individuals identifying as men or women versus those identifying as transgender. Results: The prevalence estimate of individuals identifying as transgender was 0.8\%. Individuals identifying as transgender were significantly more likely than individuals identifying as men or women to report having had a single diagnosis or co-occurring diagnoses for all three disorders examined. Additionally, transgender individuals were more likely than individuals identifying as men or women to receive a diagnosis of anxiety or depression at a younger age. Conclusion: Given the prevalence of transgender individuals and the associations with common mental health conditions, clinicians must be informed and competent to care for their clinical needs. This study introduces online crowdsourcing resources as a potentially fruitful option for reaching and researching gender diversity.},

  abstract = {Abstract Despite its origins in explorations of the political and institutional history that had become unfashionable in History departments, the Political Science subfield of American Political Development (APD) has drifted toward the ``history-from-below'' view against which it was originally a reaction. Perhaps this is a normal tendency in democratic cultures that ground their legitimacy on the will of the people. But it may also be due to a failure of APD scholars to appreciate that even in a (nominally) democratic country such as the United States, the state may acquire autonomy from the public will because of the vast scope of state activity, and the restricted ability of the people to monitor, understand, and control that activity. Philip E. Converse's signal contribution to the public-opinion literature can thus be the starting point for a revision of American political history with an eye to the autonomy that political elites may gain from public ignorance of their actions.},

Using Swedish election data, I show that one layoff notice among lowskilled native-born workers increases, on average, support for the Swedish radical right party the Sweden Democrats by 0.17--0.45 votes. The relationship between layoff notices and support for the Sweden Democrats is stronger in areas with a high share of low-skilled immigrants and in areas with a low share of high-skilled immigrants. These findings are in line with theories suggesting that economically distressed voters oppose immigration as they fear increased labor market competition. In addition, I use individual-level survey data to show that self-reported unemployment risk is positively associated with voting for the Sweden Democrats among low-skilled respondents while the opposite is true for high-skilled respondents, echoing the aggregate-level findings.},

  abstract = {Many studies investigating inquiry learning in science domains have appeared over the years. Throughout this period, inquiry learning has been regularly criticized by scholars who favor direct instruction over inquiry learning. In this vein, Zhang, Kirschner, Cobern, and Sweller (2022) recently asserted that direct instruction is overall superior to inquiry-based instruction and reproached policy makers for ignoring this fact. In the current article we reply to this assertion and the premises on which it is based. We review the evidence and argue that a more complete and correct interpretation of the literature demonstrates that inquiry-based instruction produces better overall results for acquiring conceptual knowledge than does direct instruction. We show that this conclusion holds for controlled, correlational, and program-based studies. We subsequently argue that inquiry-based and direct instruction each have their specific virtues and disadvantages and that the effectiveness of each approach depends on moderating factors such as the learning goal, the domain involved, and students' prior knowledge and other student characteristics. Furthermore, inquiry-based instruction is most effective when supplemented with guidance that can be personalized based on these moderating factors and can even involve providing direct instruction. Therefore, we posit that a combination of inquiry and direct instruction may often be the best approach to support student learning. We conclude that policy makers rightfully advocate inquiry-based instruction, particularly when students' investigations are supplemented with direct instruction at appropriate junctures.},

  abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a surge in research activity while restricting data collection methods, leading to a rise in survey-based studies. Anecdotal evidence suggests this increase in neurosurgical survey dissemination has led to a phenomenon of survey fatigue, characterized by decreased response rates and reducing the quality of data. This paper aims to analyze the effect of COVID-19 on neurosurgery surveys and their response rates, and suggest strategies for improving survey data collection.Methods: A search was conducted on March 20, 2021, on Medline and EMBASE. This included the terms ``neurosurgery,'' ``cranial surgery,'' ``spine surgery,'' and ``survey'' and identified surveys written in English, on a neurosurgical topic, distributed to neurosurgeons, trainees, and medical students. Results were screened by two authors according to these inclusion criteria, and included articles were used for data extraction, univariable, and bivariable analysis with Fisher's exact-test, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, and Spearman's correlation.Results: We included 255 articles in our analysis, 32.3\% of which were published during the COVID-19 pandemic. Surveys had an average of 25.6 (95\% CI = 22.5--28.8) questions and were mostly multiple choice (78.8\%). They were disseminated primarily by email (75.3\%, 95\% CI = 70.0--80.6\%) and there was a significant increase in dissemination via social media during the pandemic (OR = 3.50, 95\% CI = 1.30--12.0). COVID-19 surveys were distributed to more geographical regions than pre-pandemic surveys (2.1 vs. 1.5, P = 0.01) and had higher total responses (247.0 vs. 206.4, P = 0.01), but lower response rates (34.5 vs. 51.0\%, P {$<$} 0.001) than pre-COVID-19 surveys.Conclusion: The rise in neurosurgical survey distribution during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to survey fatigue, reduced response rates, and data collection quality. We advocate for population targeting to avoid over-researching, collaboration between research teams to minimize duplicate surveys, and communication with respondents to convey study importance, and we suggest further strategies to improve response rates in neurosurgery survey data collection.},

Inside the political backrooms of Ottawa, the Mad Men of Canadian politics are planning their next consumer friendly pitch. Where once politics was seen as a public service, increasingly it's seen as a business, and citizens are the customers. But its unadvertised products are voter apathy and gutless public policy. Susan Delacourt takes readers into the world of Canada's top political marketers, from the 1950s to the present, explaining how parties slice and dice their platforms for different audiences and how they manage the media. The current system divides the country into ``niche'' markets and abandons the hard political work of knitting together broad consensus or national vision. Little wonder then, that most Canadians have checked out of the political process: less than two per cent of the population belongs to a political party and fewer than half of voters under the age of thirty showed up at the ballot box in the last few federal elections. Provocative, incisive, entertaining and refreshingly non-partisan, Shopping for Votes offers a new narrative for understanding political culture in Canada.},

In rats, the estrogenic environment during pregnancy and lactation affects directly maternal behavior. This experiment was aimed to test whether the exposure to the estrogenic compound bisphenol-A (BPA; 0.040 mg/kg/die, orally) of adult female rats, from mating to weaning of the pups, could alter maternal behavior. An appropriate methodology was applied to reveal differences in the behavior of dams directed to male and female pups, testing the dams on postnatal days 3-4 and 8-9. Results show different maternal behavioral patterns towards male and female pups of control mothers, with more ano-genital licking to males than to females. Exposure of mothers to BPA modified their behavior, reducing specific components of maternal behavior, both active and passive, irrespective of the sex of pups and the period of observation. This experiment shows that maternal behavior is affected by a prolonged exposure to a low dose of BPA during pregnancy and lactation, thus suggesting an effect on neural circuits in adulthood.},

We examine the role of social context in the link between individual attitudes about the environment and recycling behavior by comparing communities that vary in their access to recycling programs. Results show that people with access to a structured recycling program have much higher levels of recycling than do people lacking such access. Furthermore, individual attitudes toward the environment affect recycling behavior only in the community with easy access to a structured recycling program. Individual concern about the environment enhances the effect of the recycling program, but does not overcome the barriers presented by lack of access.},

  abstract = {Governments often operate under considerable pressure to respond effectively to the emergence of increasingly complex policy dilemmas. This article first explains some key difficulties in bringing forth comprehensive policy interventions. Despite the ubiquity of social and political constraints to policy innovation, many failures can be attributed to public bureaucracies that are not designed to deal with complex problems, and which all too quickly exceed their policy-making capacities. This study then analyzes why comprehensive policy-making does sometimes occur, and links its occurrence to bureaucratic design factors, arguing that extending organizational capacity for innovation involves more than generous budgets and expertise. The article draws upon, and develops further, Mintzberg's ideas on administrative adhocracy to show how administrative units can be organized to enable bureaucracies to transcend professional compartmentalization and routine; and how structures can be designed for comprehensive policy innovation. The study focuses on Canadian federal bureaucracy, and it is supported by three case studies of recent policy experiments: energy, environment and AIDS. /// Les administrations publiques font face {\`a} des probl{\`e}mes sociaux de plus en plus complexes.

Drawing on panel surveys and news media content analyses the study links exposure and attention to specific media contents to changes in political knowledge and participation. While the literature on this issue is divided, this study shows that the positive effects of news media exposure outweigh the negative effects and that the effects are conditional upon actual content. Exposure to news outlets with high levels of political content (such as public television news and broadsheet newspapers) contributes the most to knowledge gains and increases the propensity to turn out to vote. Exposure to news outlets with less political content has either no effects or slightly positive effects, depending on the type of content. In other words, the effects of news media use on knowledge and participation are rather `virtuous' than `vicious'. The results are discussed in the light of research on media effects and political participation.},

Food sharing within a captive colony of chimpanzees was studied by means of 200 food trials, conducted on separate daus over a 3-year period, in which 6,972 approaches occurred among the nine adults in the colony. The success rate of each adult, A, to obtain food from another adult, B, was compared with grooming interactions between A and B in the 2 hours prior to each food trial. The tendency of B to share with A was higher if A had groomed B than if A had not done so. The exchange was partner-specific, i.e., the effect of previous grooming on the behavior of food possessors was limited to the grooming partner. Grooming did not affect subsequent sharing by the groomer, only by the groomee. The effect of grooming was greatest for pairs of adults who rarely groomed. Nevertheless, the effect was general: 31 dyadic directions showed an increase in sharing following grooming, and only 11 a decrease. Food possessors actively resisted approaches by individuals who had not groomed them. After food trials there was a significant reduction of grooming by previous possessors towards those individuals with whom they had shared.},

The standard view in research ethics is that the function of informed consent is to respect individual autonomy.

We argue that consent serves seven ethically important and conceptually distinct functions. The first four functions pertain principally to individual participants: (1) providing transparency; (2) allowing control and authorization; (3) promoting concordance with participants' values; and (4) protecting and promoting welfare interests. Three other functions are systemic or policy focused: (5) promoting trust; (6) satisfying regulatory requirements; and (7) promoting integrity in research. Reframing consent around these functions can guide approaches to consent that are context sensitive and that maximize achievable goals.},

  abstract = {One key function of political leadership is to facilitate coordinated action by ``followers.'' The need to fulfill this function can affect leaders' strategic incentives to depict the political world in one way as opposed to another when choosing political communications. This paper describes a laboratory experiment that was conducted to explore the effects of a leader's communications on followers' beliefs about the world. Interactions take place within a simple game-theoretic framework, in which a leader communicates with followers who are ex ante uncertain about the state of the world. In this framework, followers' preferences over coordination outcomes are aligned in some states, but not in others. As a result, leaders sometimes have incentives to misrepresent the state of the world in order to make coordination more likely. The key experimental finding is that leaders' communications strongly influence followers' beliefs about the world even under conditions when Bayesian-rational followers would not find these communications to be credible; followers appear not fully to account for leaders' strategic incentives to misrepresent the world in forming their posterior beliefs. This result suggests one mechanism through which members of different political groups may come to have different beliefs about the world.},

The letter signals the most dangerous schism for a party that has depended on labor support since the NDP was founded in 1961.

Now, with the politicization of the communication staff of government, he has the largest partisan, political staff in the history of B.C. It is also by far the largest of any government in Canada, including the federal government. Clearly, the B.C. government doesn't believe in sharing the pain with seniors and social assistance recipients.

This process has been dubbed problem definition by past literature, yet past work offers little more than descriptive accounts of the process. We apply a threshold model to explain how problem definition can exhibit both incremental and punctuated change. We then demonstrate the model by explaining redefinition of the sexual harassment issue following the Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination hearings. Using Box-Tiao (1975) and nonlinear time varying parameter regression methods, we show that the hearings permanently altered individual and social nonacceptance of sexual harassment, as well as initiated a process of positive feedback. Given that there are many conditions similar to sexual harassment, and given that disturbances are quite frequent, sudden change should be a common feature of the American system.},

Using a survey-based experiment, we compared four messages: a notification of the public benefits; the private benefits; a social comparison drawing on expert knowledge of housing preferences; and a control stating recent trends in the municipality. Our sample of 202 residents of a mid-sized Canadian city indicates that messages regarding the public benefits of increased density reduced NIMBYism by four times the control message. We find some evidence in favor of the efficacy of the social comparison treatment as well. We discuss these findings with reference to the literature on smart city growth, and the policy implications that emerge.},

This paper uses SEE data on over two thousand labor force participants interviewed in 1994 and 1995 to describe how Americans in the labor force perceive the risk of near-term economic misfortune. We measure economic insecurity through responses to questions eliciting subjective probabilities of three events in the year ahead: absence of health insurance, victimization by burglary, and job loss. With item response rates exceeding 98 percent, respondents clearly are willing to answer the expectations questions and they appear to do so in a meaningful way. Using the responses to classify individuals as relatively secure, relatively insecure, and highly insecure, we find that respondents with a high risk of one adverse outcome tend also to perceive high risks of the other outcomes. Economic insecurity tends to decline with age and with schooling. Black respondents perceive much greater insecurity than do whites, especially among males. Within the period 1994-1995, we find some time-series variation in insecurity but no clear trends. We find that expectations and realizations of health insurance coverage and of jobs tend to match up quite closely, but respondents substantially overpredict the risk of burglary.},

Toronto Mayor Rob Ford's personal and political troubles have occupied centre stage in North America's fourth largest city since news broke that men involved in the drug trade were selling a videotape of Ford appearing to smoke crack cocaine.  Toronto Star reporter Robyn Doolittle was one of three journalists to view the video and report on its contents in May 2013. Her dogged pursuit of the story has uncovered disturbing details about the mayor's past and embroiled the Toronto police, city councilors, and ordinary citizens in a raucous debate about the future of the city. Even before those explosive events, Ford was a divisive figure. A populist and successful city councillor, he was an underdog to become mayor in 2010.~ His politics and mercurial nature have split the amalgamated city in two. But there is far more to the story. The Fords have a long, unhappy history of substance abuse and criminal behavior. Despite their troubles, they are also one of the most ambitious families in Canada. Those close to the Fords say they often compare themselves to the Kennedys and believe they were born to lead. Regardless of whether the mayor survives the scandal, the Ford name is on the ballot in the mayoralty election of 2014.~ Fast-paced and insightful, Crazy Town is a page-turning portrait of a troubled man, a formidable family and a city caught in an jaw-dropping scandal.},

Likewise for the enclavist culture, the individualist culture and that of the isolates. There is no assumption of fixity, on the contrary, the four types are represented in any community, and social life is in permanent tension and flux.

Prisons are the most closed institutions in the justice system and receive less media attention than earlier criminal process stages. Some analysts suggest this closure stems from tight official control over media knowledge. This seems to fit with critical penal historians' descriptions of a "veiling" of the once highly public spectacle of punishment. Such control also fits with a "dominant ideology model" of the media in which journalists are subordinate to official sources in deciding news content. This research tested arguments by examining the production of prison news. The project included 18 interviews with correctional officials, various alternative news sources, and media workers, together with a literature review and analysis of prison stories. Data indicate that penal authorities cannot exert strict control over news, but are only intermittently successful in managing coverage of prisons. Data indicate that the news media are more open, diverse, and pluralistic in coverage of criminal justice than portrayed by some dominant ideology theorists.},

Democrats or liberals tend to believe that human activity is a primary cause of climate change, whereas Republicans or conservatives are much less likely to hold this belief. A prominent explanation for this divide is that it stems from directional motivated reasoning: individuals reject new information that contradicts their standing beliefs. In this Review, we suggest that the empirical evidence is not so clear, and is equally consistent with a theory in which citizens strive to form accurate beliefs but vary in what they consider to be credible evidence. This suggests a new research agenda on climate change preference formation, and has implications for effective communication.},

On its face, it would appear that the impact of partisan media is limited, given that it attracts a relatively small audience. We argue, however, that its influence may extend beyond its direct audience via a two-step communication flow. Specifically, those who watch and are impacted by partisan media outlets talk to and persuade others who did not watch. We present experimental results that demonstrate this process. We therefore show that previous studies may have significantly underestimated the effect of these outlets. We also illustrate that how the two-step communication flow works is contingent upon the precise composition of the discussion group (e.g., is it consistent of all fellow partisans or a mix of partisans?). We conclude by highlighting what our results imply about the study of media, preference formation, and partisan polarization.},

We then describe political science research that meets this challenge. We find an expansive literature that clarifies how phenomena such as parties, campaigns, and the need to act strategically affect preferences. This work provides many widely applicable insights.},

  abstract = {In a high-choice media environment, there are fears that individuals will select media and content that reinforce their existing beliefs and lead to segregation based on interest and/or partisanship. This could lead to partisan echo chambers among those who are politically interested and could contribute to a growing gap in knowledge between those who are politically interested and those who are not. However, the high-choice environment also allows individuals, including those who are politically interested, to consume a wide variety of media, which could lead them to more diverse content and perspectives. This study examines the relationship between political interest as well as media diversity and being caught in an echo chamber (measured by five different variables). Using a nationally representative survey of adult internet users in the United Kingdom (N = 2000), we find that those who are interested in politics and those with diverse media diets tend to avoid echo chambers. This work challenges the impact of echo chambers and tempers fears of partisan segregation since only a small segment of the population are likely to find themselves in an echo chamber. We argue that single media studies and studies which use narrow definitions and measurements of being in an echo chamber are flawed because they do not test the theory in the realistic context of a multiple media environment.},

  abstract = {The advent of economic neoliberalism in the 1980s triggered a shift in the world economy. In the three decades following World War II, now considered a golden age of capitalism, economic growth was high and income inequality decreasing. But in the mid-1970s this social compact was broken as the world economy entered the stagflation crisis, following a decline in the profitability of capital. This crisis opened a new phase of stagnating growth and wages, and unemployment. Interest rates as well as dividend flows rose, and income inequality widened. Economists G{\'e}rard Dum{\'e}nil and Dominique L{\'e}vy show that, despite free market platitudes, neoliberalism was a planned effort by financial interests against the postwar Keynesian compromise. The cluster of neoliberal policies--including privatization, liberalization of world trade, and reduction in state welfare benefits--is an expression of the power of finance in the world economy. The sequence of events initiated by neoliberalism was not unprecedented. In the late nineteenth century, when economic conditions were similar to those of the 1970s, a structural crisis led to the first financial hegemony culminating in the speculative boom of the late 1920s. The authors argue persuasively for stabilizing the world economy before we run headlong into another economic disaster.},

  abstract = {Epistemic communities are at their most powerful in novel and technically complex policy issues when decision-makers' and stakeholders' understandings are rudimentary. A successful epistemic community reduces uncertainty through policy learning. These lessons enable policy actors to recognize their preferences thus making such issues more tractable. However, policy learning is dynamic and has various modes. Where an epistemic community's advice points in unfavourable policy directions, rival lessons may be crafted by policy actors thus threatening an epistemic community's place as principal teacher on an issue. What happens to the influence of epistemic communities that do not attend to these alternative interpretations? Can epistemic communities teach in the `wrong' mode? Using the empirical case of the long-running hormone growth promoters saga in the European Union (EU) we show how, even in complex technical issues, learning in the epistemic mode may not dominate for long. Specifically, we identify a key barrier to epistemic communities' influence neglected in the literature: the `irony of epistemic learning'. In setting the foundational knowledge on novel issues, epistemic communities provide non-specialist governance actors with the resources to oppose the very knowledge these experts have created thereby curtailing their influence. We conclude with a discussion about whether epistemic communities can and should overcome this irony.},

In this article, we provide three lessons. First, there are four different modes in which constellations of actors learn. Hence our propositions about learning are conditional on which of the four contexts we refer to. Second, policy learning does not just happen; there are specific hindrances and triggers. Thus, learning can be facilitated by knowing the mechanisms to activate and the likely obstacles. Third, learning itself is a conditional final aim: although the official aspiration of public organisations and politicians is to improve on public policy, policy learning can also be dysfunctional -- for an organisation, a policy, a constellation of actors or even democracy.},

The purpose of this paper is to (1) introduce the intra-individual response variability (IRV) index as an easily calculated and flexible way to detect insufficient effort responding (IER); (2) examine the extent to which various IER indices detect the same or different respondents engaging in IER behavior; and (3) investigate relationships between individual differences and commonly used IER indices to better understand systematic and theoretically relevant IER behavior. In a two-part study, 199 undergraduates responded to questionnaires online, and various IER indices were calculated. The IRV index identifies different respondents than other IER indices. Values on the IRV index (as well as other IER indices) are related to scores on theoretically meaningful individual differences in conscientiousness, agreeableness, and boredom proneness. This study provides researchers with a robust, easily calculated, and flexible means for screening questionnaire data for IER behavior. Practical recommendations for finding and making decisions about IER behavior patterns are provided. This study introduces the IRV index, an extension of the long string, used to identify survey research participants who likely engaged in one type of IER behavior. It is also one of the first studies to evaluate the extent to which IER indices identify different respondents as having engaged in IER and provides additional evidence that values on these indices are related to individual differences.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The Canada Assistance Plan, adopted in 1966, was probably the most harmonious product of the cooperative federalism process. Five main aspects of the Plan support this judgment. Both levels of government saw the need for such a measure and both were intensely involved in establishing its basic contents. Federal officials were extremely sensitive to provincial demands for flexibility, in the third place, and a unique process of federal-provincial consultation on the details of the measure took place at the formulation stage. Finally, the Plan was implemented in the same kind of intimate federal-provincial interaction. Although few areas of conflict arose in this whole development, a bargaining model can be applied to them with interesting results. This exercise reveals that while bargaining was little in evidence in this case, it did not always follow patterns we have come to expect. The unusual degree of harmony involved in this case is related to the general deference to professional norms, to the fact that the initiative came largely from the provinces and to the attitude of federal officials toward the provinces. Sommaire. Le R{\'e}gime d'assistance publique du Canada, adopt{\'e}e en 1966, est sans doute le produit le plus harmonieux du m{\'e}canisme du f{\'e}d{\'e}ralisme coop{\'e}ratif. Cinq aspects du regime justifient ce jugement. Les deux niveaux de gouvernement reconnurent le besoin de cette mesure et s'occup{\`e}rent de fa{\c c}on intensive d'en {\'e}tablir les bases. Les repr{\'e}sentants f{\'e}d{\'e}raux furent tr{\`e}s r{\'e}ceptifs aux demandes provinciales dans le but d'introduire une certaine souplesse, et en troisi{\`e}me lieu, l'{\'e}tablissement d'un m{\'e}canisme original de consultation f{\'e}d{\'e}rale-provinciale au moment de la formulation. Finalement, cette m{\^e}me interaction mtime f{\'e}d{\'e}rale-provinciale pr{\'e}sida {\`a} la mise en oeuvre du r{\'e}gime.

  abstract = {A review of research findings and polling data about Americans' attitudes on climate change reveals a lack of meaningful long-term change in mass opinion. Instead, the structure of Americans' attitudes toward belief in climate change's existence, concern about its consequences, and demand for policy response is similar to that regarding many other issues in contemporary US politics: stability in aggregate opinion that masks partisan and ideological polarization enhanced by communications from elites. But features of the climate change problem elicit some distinctive determinants of opinion, including individuals' trust in science, risk processing, and personal experience. Although our review of the literature and data leaves us skeptical that majority opinion will spur elected officials anytime soon to undertake the costly solutions necessary to tackle this problem comprehensively at the national level, we identify several avenues by which attitudes might promote less substantial but nevertheless consequential policy action.},

  abstract = {While social class served as a powerful organizing identity for much of the 19th and 20th centuries, many doubt its contemporary relevance. This article examines the formation and development of theories of class identity over the past century. From a debate largely among Marxists in the early 20th century about the conditions under which the working class will mobilize to defend its interests -- moving from a ``class in itself'' to a ``class for itself'' -- the question of the relationship between individuals' class position, social interests, and political mobilization attracted greater attention among social scientists following World War II. However, postwar socioeconomic transformations led some to argue for the ``death of class'' as a central organizing principle for modern social and political life. While others countered that class identities remained relevant, the sharp decline in class-based organization in the late 20th century led scholars to develop more nuanced understandings of the relationship between individuals' class position and collective identities. Although current scholarship shows that there is no natural translation of class identities into collective action, the reality of growing socioeconomic inequality, along with the resurgence of social and political mobilizations to contest that growth, suggests that class identities retain the capacity to unite.},

Common explanations cite employment shifts, public opinion, labor laws, and differences in working class culture and organization. But comparing the United States with Canada challenges those explanations. After following US unionization rates for decades, Canadian rates diverged in the 1960s, and are now nearly three times higher. This divergence was due to different processes of working class political incorporation. In the United States, labor was incorporated as an interest group into a labor regime governed by a pluralist idea. In Canada, labor was incorporated as a class representative into a labor regime governed by a class idea. This led to a relatively stronger Canadian labor regime that better held employers in check and protected workers' collective bargaining rights. As a result, union density stabilized in Canada while plummeting in the United States.},

  abstract = {Why is there no labor party in the United States? This question has had deep implications for U.S. politics and social policy. Existing explanations use ``reflection'' models of parties, whereby parties reflect preexisting cleavages or institutional arrangements. But a comparison with Canada, whose political terrain was supposedly more favorable to labor parties, challenges reflection models. Newly compiled electoral data show that underlying social structures and institutions did not affect labor party support as expected: support was similar in both countries prior to the 1930s, then diverged. To explain this, I propose a modified ``articulation'' model of parties, emphasizing parties' role in assembling and naturalizing political coalitions within structural constraints. In both cases, ruling party responses to labor and agrarian unrest during the Great Depression determined which among a range of possible political alliances actually emerged. In the United States, FDR used the crisis to mobilize new constituencies. Rhetorical appeals to the ``forgotten man'' and policy reforms absorbed some farmer and labor groups into the New Deal coalition and divided and excluded others, undermining labor party support. In Canada, mainstream parties excluded farmer and labor constituencies, leaving room for the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) to organize them into a third-party coalition.},

At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, the OPH COVID-19 Case and Contact Management Team was established to help manage the spread of COVID-19 and support individuals who test positive, and their close contacts. Intervention In order to guide and support the COVID-19 Case and Contact Management Team, the COVID-19 Strategic Support Team implemented an anonymous internal communication tool called the COVID-19 Case Management Forum. Case and Contact Management employees were invited to submit their questions, concerns, and words of encouragement on the forum, and the COVID-19 Strategic Support Team routinely replied to forum submissions via team email. Outcomes Qualitative analyses of employee forum submissions revealed 6 main themes and 31 unique sub-themes related to questions, concerns, and feelings that arose throughout this pandemic response. Recurrent themes emerged relating to process questions, communication challenges, solution generation, and feelings of frustration. Summative content analyses of the COVID-19 Strategic Support team's replies demonstrated 6 main answer types: explaining procedures, identifying resources, explaining rationales, human resource explanations, sharing employee feedback with relevant parties, and creating practice tools. Implications The online forum tool was developed and implemented early in the pandemic response to provide key insights into OPH's public health workforce needs and well-being throughout the COVID-19 response. The forum encouraged open dialogue and provided opportunities to establish clarity in a time of rapid situational change.},

  abstract = {Future alternatives to the presently accepted in vitro paradigm of prediction of intrinsic clearance, which could be used earlier in the drug discovery process, would potentially accelerate efforts to identify better drug candidates with more favorable metabolic profiles and less likelihood of failure with regard to human pharmacokinetic attributes. In this study we describe two computational methods for modeling human microsomal and hepatocyte intrinsic clearance data derived from our laboratory and the literature, which utilize pharmacophore features or descriptors derived from molecular structure. Human microsomal intrinsic clearance data generated for 26 known therapeutic drugs were used to build computational models using commercially available software (Catalyst and Cerius(2)), after first converting the data to hepatocyte intrinsic clearance. The best Catalyst pharmacophore model gave an r of 0.77 for the observed versus predicted clearance. This pharmacophore was described by one hydrogen bond acceptor, two hydrophobic features, and one ring aromatic feature essential to discriminate between high and low intrinsic clearance. The Cerius(2) quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) model gave an r(2) = 0.68 for the observed versus predicted clearance and a cross-validated r(2) (q(2)) of 0.42. Similarly, literature data for human hepatocyte intrinsic clearance for 18 therapeutic drugs were also used to generate two separate models using the same computational approaches. The best Catalyst pharmacophore model gave an improved r of 0.87 and was described by two hydrogen bond acceptors, one hydrophobe, and 1 positive ionizable feature. The Cerius(2) QSAR gave an r(2) of 0.88 and a q(2) of 0.79. Each of these models was then used as a test set for prediction of the intrinsic clearance data in the other data set, with variable successes. These present models represent a preliminary application of QSAR software to modeling and prediction of human in vitro intrinsic clearance.},

This article critically reassesses the sdm, points to potential biases, and proposes solutions that suggest a different interpretation of the data, which the authors label the representative democracy model (rdm). After testing the sdm against the rdm on public opinion data and on a new data set on fiscal policy, they find that middle-class power has remained remarkably strong over time, even as inequality has risen. The authors conclude that the rich have little influence on redistributive policies, and that the democratic state is apparently not increasingly constrained by global capital.},

These initiatives have taken the form of both "top-down" strategies (preparing environmental governance authorities to receive traditional knowledge) and "bottom-up" strategies (fostering the capacity of aboriginal people to bring traditional knowledge to bear in environmental decision making). Unfortunately, most of these strategies have had only marginally beneficial effects, primarily because they failed to overcome certain significant barriers. These include communication barriers, arising from the different languages and styles of expression used by traditional knowledge holders; conceptual barriers, stemming from the organizations' difficulties in comprehending the values, practices, and context underlying traditional knowledge; and political barriers, resulting from an unwillingness to acknowledge traditional-knowledge messages that may conflict with the agendas of government or industry. Still other barriers emanate from the co-opting of traditional knowledge by non-aboriginal researchers and their institutions. These barriers help maintain a power imbalance between the practitioners of science and European-style environmental governance and the aboriginal people and their traditional knowledge. This imbalance fosters the rejection of traditional knowledge or its transformation and assimilation into Euro-Canadian ways of knowing and doing.},

For these reasons, being a political scientist means facing myriad questions about how we know what we claim to know. Transparency can help political scientists address these questions. An emerging literature and set of practices suggest that sharing more data and providing more information about our analytic and interpretive choices can help others understand the rigor and relevance of our claims. At the same time, increasing transparency can be costly and has been contentious. This review describes opportunities created by, and difficulties posed by, attempts to increase transparency. We conclude that, despite the challenges, consensus about the value and practice of transparency is emerging within and across political science\&apos;s diverse and dynamic research communities.},

  abstract = {How much has rising political attention to problems of housing affordability translated into support for market-rate housing development? A tacit assumption of YIMBY (``Yes In My Backyard'') activists is that more public attention to housing affordability will engender more support for their policy agenda of removing regulatory barriers to dense market-rate housing. Yet recent research finds that the mass public has little conviction that more housing supply would improve affordability, which in turn raises questions about the depth of public support for supply-side policies relative to price controls, demand subsidies, or restrictions on ``Wall Street'' investors, to name a few. In a national survey of 5,000 urban and suburban voters, we elicited perceptions of the efficacy of a wide range of potential state policies for ``helping people get housing they can afford.'' We also asked respondents whether they support various housing and non-housing policies. Finally, as a way of estimating the revealed importance of housing-policy preferences relative to the more conventional grist of state politics, we elicited preferences over randomized, three-policy platforms. In a set of results that recall the politics of the inflation-ridden 1970s, we find that homeowners and renters alike support price controls, demand subsidies, restrictions on Wall Street buyers, and subsidized affordable housing. The revealed-preference results further suggest, contrary to our expectations, that price controls and anti ``Wall Street'' restrictions are very important to voters. Contrary to the recommendations of housing economists and other experts, allowing more market-rate housing is regarded as ineffective and draws only middling levels of public support. Opponents of market-rate housing development also care more about the issue than do supporters. Finally, we show that people who claim that housing is very important to them don't have distinctive housing-policy preferences.},

After four years of collaboration, the authors produced this incisive account of their idea of Communism, in which they envisage a society without classes, private property or a state. They argue that increasing exploitation of industrial workers will eventually lead to a revolution in which capitalism is overthrown. Their vision transformed the world irrevocably, and remains relevant as a depiction of global capitalism today.Edited with an Introduction by GARETH STEDMAN JONES},

We investigated whether infants' expectations about resource distribution can be modulated by information about the dominance structure between the recipients. We first replicated the finding that infants attribute a stable dominance hierarchy to a pair of individuals when their goals conflicted and one individual yielded to the other (Expt. 1), and that this sensitivity is not driven by lower-level perceptual factors (Expt. 2). In Experiments 3-5, we tested our main hypothesis that infants' attention to equal and unequal distributions varies as a function of prior social dominance information. We first replicated and extended prior work by establishing that infants looked significantly longer to unequal than equal resource distributions when no prior information about dominance was provided about recipients (Expt. 3). Critically, following social dominance information, infants looked significantly longer to an equal distribution of resources than a distribution that favored the dominant individual (Expt. 4), and looked significantly longer when the submissive individual received more resources compared to when the dominant individual received more resources (Expts. 4 and 5). Together, these findings suggest that infants expect resources to align with social dominance structures.},

Scott Althaus's Collective Preferences in Democratic Politics challenges this revisionist optimism, arguing that opinion polls misrepresent the interests of a large segment of society, and that they therefore get too much attention as a guide to policy makers, because those being polled are so ill informed. But Althaus overestimates the degree to which respondent ignorance is responsible for the instability of survey responses; and he is perhaps too critical of polling as the vehicle for transmitting voter interests. His analysis of information effects on political attitudes, however, raises the important question of how public opinion would be different if it were well informed. The answer is, I believe: only minimally different.},

We use panel data on legislative activity in 133 countries over the period 1999--2016 to identify statistically the short-term and long-term impact of climate legislation. Each new law reduces annual carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions per unit of gross domestic product by 0.78\% nationally in the short term (during the first three years) and by 1.79\% in the long term (beyond three years). The results are driven by parliamentary acts and by countries with a strong rule of law. In 2016, current climate laws were associated with an annual reduction in global CO2 emissions of 5.9 GtCO2, more than the US CO2 output that year. Cumulative CO2 emissions savings from 1999 to 2016 amount to 38 GtCO2, or one year's worth of global CO2 output. The impact on other greenhouse gases is much lower.},

G{\o}sta Esping-Andersen, one of the foremost contributors to current debates on this issue, here provides a new analysis of the character and role of welfare states in the functioning of contemporary advanced Western societies. Esping-Andersen distinguishes three major types of welfare state, connecting these with variations in the historical development of different Western countries. He argues that current economic processes, such as those moving toward a postindustrial order, are shaped not by autonomous market forces but by the nature of states and state differences. Fully informed by comparative materials, this book will have great appeal to all those working on issues of economic development and postindustrialism. Its audience will include students of sociology, economics, and politics.},

Philosophers, theologians, lawyers, politicians, and the public have arrived at distinct understandings about what the common good entails, how it should be balanced against individual goods, and if and by whom it should be enforced. Though there are many critics of the notion of the common good (as will be discussed below), it has survived as a meaningful concept for well over two millennia, and continues to serve as a very significant organizing principle of civic and political life.},

  abstract = {In this paper we examine new empirical evidence on the coherence and magnitude of the main classes in the Goldthorpe class schema. Particular attention is paid to issues that have recently been a source of academic dispute: the coherence and size of the service class and the distinction between the service class and intermediate classes. Using recently available British data collected by the Office for National Statistics we examine: (i) the extent to which measures of class-relevant job characteristics are empirically discriminated by the categories of the schema; (ii) the structure of a `contract type' dimension of employment relations conceived of as a categorical latent variable; and (iii) the association between this latent variable and both the Goldthorpe class schema and a related measure--socio-economic group (SEG). We find that the data are consistent with the existence of a three category latent `contract type' variable largely corresponding to the notions of service, intermediate and wage-labour contracts explicit in discussions of the theoretical rationale for the Goldthorpe schema. We further find a substantial degree of fit between the latent `contract types' and the schema. However, the service class fault line appears to lie within class I and II of the schema rather than between them and the intermediate classes which suggests a revised, smaller service class would better capture the reality of the contemporary British occupational structure.},

We discover growing differences in aggregate attitudes towards force and violence and social welfare, but not feminism and equality. The greatest gender gaps appear among young, university-educated, and employed people. Furthermore, gender gaps on feminist issues appear with controls for these variables. We conclude that changing gender gaps result from the interaction of role change and socialization by the women's movement and suggest that youth, education and paid employment combine to create a gender consciousness among women.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the link between the public health measures of quarantine and sanitation and the creation of racially-segregated reserves in the Canadian Northwest. In the fall of 1876, a smallpox epidemic broke out among Icelandic settlers and Aboriginal people living along the southwest coast of Lake Winnipeg. In response government officials formed a Board of Health and took measures to prevent the spread of the disease. The affected district was placed under a rigid quarantine and health officers were sent out to treat the victims and vaccinate people in adjacent communities. Due to both these measures and the diligence of local people, the disease was effectively contained and the number of dead, while significant, did not reach the levels of previous smallpox epidemics. However, the public health response to the crisis had far reaching consequences. By extending and legitimating the authority of the Canadian state over a region where its influence was previously quite limited, quarantine and sanitation helped reify a new colonial order mandating the compartmentalization of land and people into a system of Indian and immigrant reservations.},

On the one hand, they are senior public servants who confidentially advise government on public health matters and manage the implementation of government priorities. On the other hand, CMOHs are perceived as independent communicators and advocates for public health. This article analyzes public health legislation across Canada that governs the CMOH role. Our legal analysis reveals that the presence and degree of advisory, communication, and management roles for the CMOH vary considerably across the country. In many jurisdictions, the power and authority of the CMOH is not clearly defined in legislation. This creates great potential for confusion and conflict, particularly with respect to CMOHs' authority to act as public health advocates. We call on governments to clarify their preferences when it comes to the CMOH role and either amend the relevant statute or otherwise find ways to clarify the mandate of their CMOHs.},

A sophisticated mix of theoretical, conceptual and empirical analysis serves as a guide to the challenges inherent in making public policy that accounts for and improves population health.'' -- Tom McIntosh, Professor of Politics and International Studies, University of Regina, Canada ``The editors of this important book have assembled an impressive group of experts who understand the worlds of both public health, policy theory, and political science. They offer important insights into the challenges and opportunities of integrating these disciplines to the benefit of both.'' -- Ilona Kickbusch, Professor and Founder of the Global Health Centre, Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, Switzerland This open access book bridges the divide between political science and public health, whilst simultaneously embracing the complexities and differences of both. Although public health is inherently political, the tools and insights of political science are often ignored in public health scholarship. Bringing together academics and researchers working at the intersection of both, the book demonstrates how integrating these fields can help reconcile the roles of politics and scientific evidence in policymaking. It also highlights the key conceptual, methodological and substantive implications for bridging this divide, and charts a path forward for a movement towards political science with public health.

Harm reduction and safe injection sites are an attempt to address this problem and are at the cutting edge of public health policy and practice. One of the most studied safe injection sites is INSITE located in Vancouver, British Columbia. Using INSITE as a case study, this paper argues that knowledge translation offers a limited framework for understanding the development of public health policy. This paper also argues that the experience of INSITE suggests that science and social justice, the meta-ideas that lie at the core of the public health enterprise, are an inadequate basis for a theory of public health policy making. However, on a more positive note, INSITE also shows the value of concepts drawn from the ways in which political science analyzes the policy process.},

However, using examples drawn from public health policy, it is clear that work in political science on multiplicity, hierarchy and networks can offer some insight into what effective KT might look like for informing public policy. To be effective, KT approaches must be more appropriately tailored depending on the audience size, audience breadth, the policy context, and the dominant policy instrument.},

  abstract = {That public health policy and practice should be evidence based is a seemingly uncontroversial claim. Yet governments and citizens routinely reject the best available evidence and prefer policies that reflect other considerations and concerns. The most common explanations of this paradox emphasise scientific disagreement, the power of `politics', or the belief that scientists and policymakers live in two separate communities that do not communicate. However, another explanation may lie in the limits of the very notion of evidence-based policy making. In fact, the social science discipline of political science offers a rich body of theory and empirical evidence to explain the apparent gap between evidence and policy. This essay introduces this literature with a particular emphasis on a recent book by Katherine Smith, Beyond evidence-based policy in public health: the interplay of ideas. As the title suggests, Smith argues that what matters for public health policy is less scientific evidence and much more a more complex set of ideas. Based on detailed case studies of UK tobacco and health inequality policy, Smith offers a richly textured alternative account of what matters for policy making. This excellent book is part of a small but growing body of political science research on public health policy that draws on contemporary theories of policy change and governance more generally. This essay provides a window on this research, describes some examples, but emphasises that public health scholars and practitioners too often retain a narrow if not naive view of the policy-making process.},

While some have read these analyses as broadly consistent, providing support for the view that e-cigarettes could play a role in smoking harm reduction, in every major respect, they come to very different conclusions about what the evidence suggests in terms of public health policy. How is that possible?The explanation rests in what the 2 reports see as the central challenge posed by e-cigarettes, which helped to determine what counted as evidence. For NASEM, the core question was how to protect nonsmokers from the potential risks of exposure to nicotine and other contaminants or from the risk of smoking combustible cigarettes through renormalization. A precautionary standard was imperative, making evidence that could speak most conclusively to the question of causality paramount. For PHE, the priority was how to reduce the burdens now borne by current smokers, burdens reflected in measurable patterns of morbidity and mortality. With a focus on immediate harms, PHE turned to evidence that was ``relevant and meaningful.''Thus, competing priorities determined what counted as evidence when it came to the impact of e-cigarettes on current smokers, nonsmoking bystanders, and children and adolescents. A new clinical trial demonstrating the efficacy of e-cigarettes as a cessation tool makes understanding how values and framing shape core questions and conclusive evidence imperative.},

Electoral systems have experienced major reform in many countries including Italy, Israel, and Japan, and new parties have changed the face of competition in Germany, France, and Belgium. The emerging democracies of Eastern Europe and Latin America have also established new party systems with competitive elections. Integrating and synthesizing the most recent research in the field of elections, Comparing Democracies offers selections from a team of renowned international scholars writing on their areas of specialty. Contributors provide a cross-national study comparing elections in a number of democracies and discussing key topics associated with the study of elections including electoral laws, campaign finance regulations, media communications, and voter turnout. This prestigious volume is an invaluable addition to the literature on elections and voting behavior, comparative democracy, and area studies. It will also serve as a standard reference for graduate students in comparative politics.},

There has been a shift from parties selling themselves to voters to designing an appropriate product to match voter needs. Because of these changes, contemporary political parties have repositioned themselves to survive the uncertainties of operating as representative institutions in the increasingly participatory age of the end of the millennium.},

I argue that what constitutes a ``domestic-political'' explanation of a state's foreign policy choices has not been clearly elaborated. What counts as a domestic-political explanation is defined by opposition to systemic or structural explanations. But these may be specified in several different ways---I spell out two---each of which implies a different concept of domesticpolitical explanations. If a systemic IR theory pictures states as unitary, rational actors, then a domestic-political explanation is one in which domesticpolitical interactions in at least one state yield a suboptimal foreign policy relative to some normative standard. Or, if a systemic IR theory pictures states as unitary, rational actors and also requires that attributes of particular states not enter the explanation, then a domestic-political explanation is any one that involves state characteristics other than relative power. Implications of each approach are developed, and examples from the literature are provided. I also address the question of whether there is a sharp distinction between a ``systemic theory of international politics'' and a ``theory of foreign policy,'' arguing that there is an important and natural sense in which they are the same.},

To appreciate the development of group-based models, it will be useful to begin with a discussion of the decision-theoretic literature on voting, with a focus on the paradox of not voting. Then we will move to the game-theoretic and group-based models of voting. A conclusion highlights some of the problems that group-based models of voting must address.},

We answer this question in the context of U.S. cities, where women's participation in mayoral elections increased from negligible numbers in 1970 to about one-third of the elections in the 2000's. A novel data set of U.S. mayoral elections from 1950 to 2005 was used, and a regression discontinuity design was employed to deal with the endogeneity of female candidacy to city characteristics. In contrast to most research on the influence of female leadership, we find no effect of gender of the mayor on policy outcomes related to the size of local government, the composition of municipal spending and employment, or crime rates. These results hold both in the short and the long run. While female mayors do not implement different policies, they do appear to have higher unobserved political skills, as they have at least a 5 percentage point higher incumbent effect than a comparable male. But we find no evidence of political spillovers: exogenously electing a female mayor does not change the long run political success of other female mayoral candidates in the same city or of female candidates in local congressional elections.},

By examining Xenophon's portrayal of Cyrus' nature, education, and actions, and by comparing Cyrus to other characters of the Cyropaedia, I come to a different conclusion. Cyrus' limits prove not to be inevitable, and the failure of his empire is not ``generalizable'' to all political endeavors. In studying Cyrus' case, we deepen our thinking about civic education, justice, rule, freedom, and the law---matters that Cyrus neglected---and are led to prudential insights that are vital to the cultivation and support of healthy politics.},

Danes are more skeptical toward non-Western immigration than Germans. Essentially, less educated Danes are very critical of accepting non-Western immigrants in their country.

There are first forces of change, which propel suburbs in new directions. Much of the present literature on suburbs highlights suburban transitions in the form of social and economic diversification, and of new forms of development. The article attempts to rebalance the discourse on suburbs by emphasizing forces of durability. It does not deny the importance of observed suburban transitions, but argues that there is, at the heart of North American suburbs, an enduring automobility-induced transportation dynamic, which reverberates on most aspects of suburbs. The article explores the mechanisms undergirding suburban durability by linking the suburban transportation dynamic to the self-reproductive effects of a suburban lifestyle and culture and their political manifestations. These forces impede planning attempts to transform suburbs in ways that make them more environmentally sustainable. To empirically ground its argument, the article draws on two Toronto region case studies illustrating processes assuring the persistence of the durable features of North American suburbs: the layout of large suburban multifunctional centres and the themes raised by Rob Ford during his successful 2010 mayoralty electoral campaign.},

  abstract = {Researchers in many disciplines work with ranking data. This data type is unique in that it is often deterministic in nature (the ranks of items k-1 determine the rank of item k), and the difference in a pair of rank scores separated by k units is equivalent regardless of the actual values of the two ranks in the pair. Given its unique qualities, there are specific statistical analyses and models designed for use with ranking data. The purpose of this manuscript is to demonstrate a strategy for analyzing ranking data from sample description through the modeling of relative ranks and inference regarding differences in ranking patterns between groups. An example dataset of university faculty ratings of job characteristics was used to demonstrate these various methods, and the ways in which they can be tied together to obtain a comprehensive understanding of a ranking dataset. The analyses were carried out using libraries from the R software package, and the code for this purpose is included in the appendix to the manuscript.},

  abstract = {This paper re-examines the commonly observed inverse relationship between perceived risk and perceived benefit. We propose that this relationship occurs because people rely on affect when judging the risk and benefit of specific hazards. Evidence supporting this proposal is obtained in two experimental studies. Study 1 investigated the inverse relationship between risk and benefit judgments under a time-pressure condition designed to limit the use of analytic thought and enhance the reliance on affect. As expected, the inverse relationship was strengthened when time pressure was introduced. Study 2 tested and confirmed the hypothesis that providing information designed to alter the favorability of one's overall affective evaluation of an item (say nuclear power) would systematically change the risk and benefit judgments for that item. Both studies suggest that people seem prone to using an `affect heuristic' which improves judgmental efficiency by deriving both risk and benefit evaluations from a common source---affective reactions to the stimulus item.

In the interests of having better informed debates, the present paper reviews existing empirical evidence about public risk perceptions.

These limitations are significant from the standpoint of democratic theory, but it is possible to design forms of public consultation and of social-science research that will reveal what public opinion might be like if these limitations were somehow overcome. Deliberative Polling is an effort to explore the contours of such a counterfactual public opinion---one that is more informed and engaged than is the mass public. Doing so requires going beyond ``polling alone.''},

In an effort to enhance our understanding of this politically relevant ``silent revolution,'' an alternate theory of value change is presented, contrasting Inglehart's ``needs theory'' approach with a ``functional constraints'' theoretic construct. It is then argued that both kinds of value change are taking place, the first a change in the priorities attached to economic as opposed to noneconomic, value issues as measured by a materialism-nonmaterialism scale, and the second a change in basic social value preferences as measured by an authoritarian-libertarian scale. It is further argued that Inglehart's acquisitive-postbourgeois value scale combines both of these value priority and value preference dimensions. Relying primarily on Japanese data, it is demonstrated that these two subdimensions have sharply contrasting properties in both their causal origins and behavioral properties and hence are preferably kept distinct. Finally it is shown that the alternate theory and measurement of value change presented here overcome several problems in the Inglehart approach.},

This is particularly so in the field of political leadership, which has been afflicted by an enduring split between the biographical idiosyncrasies of individual leaders and the specialist contributions from an array of social science disciplines. This new study is designed to establish an improved balance between this often myopic and confusing bifurcation of approaches. It engages with an expansive range of empirical, theoretical, and interpretive research into the issue of leadership but does so in a way that ensures that the political character of the subject is kept securely in the foreground. The project is therefore designed to maintain a clear emphasis upon leaders embedded in their political contexts and viscerally connected to high level issues of political location and status, political power and legitimacy, and political functions and contingencies. The book has a cumulative design that moves from an in-depth analysis of the basic components of political leadership to an examination of a series of key dimensions relating to leadership activity and development--namely the themes of representation, communication, marketing, business practice, and the issue of women leaders. It goes on to survey the developmental properties of the international sphere before concluding with a substantive review of the changing landscapes of contemporary leadership activity and the different ways that we come to terms with the theme of political leadership in an increasingly complex world.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACTChristopher Achen and Larry Bartels's Democracy for Realists makes a persuasive case that standard theories of democracy rest on shaky empirical ground, and that optimistically interpreted empirical findings about public competence do not save the day. However, I argue that the solution does not lie with theories of elite competition or accountability to other institutions. Instead, I turn to theories of symbolic politics. These theories capture the empirical reality of how voters engage with politics and make decisions. While they tend to emphasize human irrationality, they also contain the potential for a symbolic kind of rationality that could provide a solid foundation for democratic politics.},

  abstract = {The results of the 2011 Canadian federal election were surprising. What accounts for the dramatic and largely unexpected shift in electoral fortunes? Most importantly, what accounts for the sudden leap in popularity of the New Democratic Party, particularly in Quebec? The aftermath of election day produced no lack of potential explanations. Pundits, politicians, and political scientists have suggested many. This paper examines the empirical validity of various explanations swirling about the 2011 election, especially regarding the "orange surge." The analysis relies upon the 2011 Canadian Election Study and the content of news media coverage. It concludes that the most important factors behind the orange wave were the image gap between Jack Layton and the other party leaders, as well as the proximity between the NDP's values and issue positions and those of many Quebeckers. Le r{\'e}sultat de l'{\'e}lection f{\'e}d{\'e}rale canadienne de 2011 a {\'e}t{\'e} surprenant. Comment expliquer les renversements dramatiques et largement inattendus dans les appuis aux partis politiques? Surtout, comment expliquer le bond soudain de popularit{\'e} du Nouveau parti d{\'e}mocratique, particuli{\`e}rement au Qu{\'e}bec? Plusieurs explications potentielles ont {\'e}t{\'e} sugg{\'e}r{\'e}es par les commentateurs, les politiciens et les politologues au lendemain de l'{\'e}lection. Cet article examine la validit{\'e} empirique de nombreuses explications entourant l'{\'e}lection de 2011, notamment celles portant sur la << vague orange >>. L'analyse repose sur l'{\'E}tude {\'e}lectorale canadienne de 2011 ainsi que sur le contenu de la couverture m{\'e}diatique. Elle indique que les facteurs les plus importants {\`a} l'origine de la vague orange ont {\'e}t{\'e} l'{\'e}cart entre l'image de Jack Layton et celle des autres chefs de partis, de m{\^e}me que la proximit{\'e} entre le NPD et plusieurs Qu{\'e}b{\'e}cois quant aux valeurs et aux enjeux.},

By complex, I mean a model that contains terms related by marginality or hierarchy, such as polynomial terms, or main effects and interactions. I call these tables or graphs effect displays. Effect displays are constructed by identifying high-order terms in a generalised linear model. Fitted values under the model are computed for each such term. The lower-order `relatives' of a high-order term (e.g., main effects marginal to an interaction) are absorbed into the term, allowing the predictors appearing in the high-order term to range over their values. The values of other predictors are fixed at typical values: for example, a covariate could be fixed at its mean or median, a factor at its proportional distribution in the data, or to equal proportions in its several levels. Variations of effect displays are also described, including representation of terms higher-order to any appearing in the model.},

We argue that this reflects that lower class status predicts liberal economic attitudes, but conservative views on cultural and racial issues, while the parties are consistently liberal or conservative, creating conflicts for many voters. How do voters settle such internal conflicts? We argue that the salience that voters attach to these different types of issues determines how policy attitudes, and indirectly class, shapes voting. Using ANES and GSS data since the 1970s, we find that class consistently predicts economic and cultural/minority policy attitudes, and that lower class voters who place more salience on economic issues, and upper class voters for whom cultural issues are more salient, are more likely to support the Democratic Party in presidential elections.},

  abstract = {The media reporting of the Ethiopian Famine in 1984-5 was an iconic news event. It is widely believed to have had an unprecedented impact, challenging perceptions of Africa and mobilising public opinion and philanthropic action in a dramatic new way. The contemporary international configuration of aid, media pressure, and official policy is still directly affected and sometimes distorted by what was----as this narrative shows----also an inaccurate and misleading story. In popular memory, the reporting of the Ethiopian famine and the resulting humanitarian intervention were a great success. Yet alternative interpretations give a radically different picture of misleading journalism and an aid effort which did more harm than good. Using privileged access to BBC and Government archives, Reporting Disasters examines and reveals the internal factors which drove BBC news and offers a rare case study of how the media can affect public opinion and policymaking. It constructs the process that accounts for the immensity of the news event, following the response at the heart of government to the pressure of public opinion. And it shows that, while the reporting and the altruistic festival that it produced triggered remarkable and identifiable changes, the ongoing impact was not what the conventional account claims it to have been.},

Using data from a survey experiment in which respondents view simulated Twitter newsfeeds, we demonstrate the dilemma facing news organizations that have published false information. Encouragingly, media retractions are effective at informing the public -- they increase the accuracy of news consumers' beliefs about the retracted reporting more than information from third parties questioning the original reporting or even the combination of the two. However, trust in the news outlet declines after a retraction, though this effect is small both substantively and in standardized terms relative to the increase in belief accuracy. This reputational damage persists even if the outlet issues a retraction before a third party questions the story. In a social media environment that frequently subjects reporting to intense scrutiny, the journalistic mission of news organizations to inform the public will increasingly conflict with organizational incentives to avoid admitting error.},

  abstract = {Zaller's Nature and Origins of Mass Opinion initially sets out an epistemic view of politics in which the ultimate determinants of political action are ideas about the society in which we act. These ideas are usually mediated to us by others, so Zaller begins the book by describing its topic as the influence of the media on public opinion, and he includes journalists among the ``political elites'' who exert this influence (along with politicians, public officials, and experts). But the book eventually reduces journalists to being messengers of politicians' cues to the public. This understanding of the media is built into the book's model of opinion formation, in which cued predispositions are pivotal to the acceptance or rejection of culturally mediated ``messages''---but are themselves insulated from cultural influence. A cueing model of message reception, however, ignores messages that are differentially persuasive not because of the predispositions they cue but the content they convey. Gauging the heterogeneous persuasiveness of messages requires qualitative content analysis and cultural contextualization, and if this research is to contribute to a general understanding of public opinion, it will have to extend beyond news-media messages to ideational influences carried in high culture, formal education, and the entertainment media. All of these sources of ideas, in turn, may contribute to the shaping of predispositions, as suggested in part by public opinion regarding the Vietnam War. Research of this kind would signal a new type of political science that focused on the actual thoughts of real people trying to understand a complex environment: exactly the type of political science suggested at the beginning of Zaller's book.},

On the one hand, lacking comprehensive cognitive structures, such as ideological ``belief systems,'' with which to understand politics, most people learn distressingly little about it. On the other hand, a spiral of conviction seems to make it difficult for the highly informed few to see any aspects of politics but those that confirm the cognitive structures that organize their political perceptions. This is a troubling situation for any consequentialist democratic political theory, according to which what is crucial is the electorate's (and subsidiary decision makers') ability to make informed policy judgments, not their possession of willful but uninformed political ``attitudes.'' Any political theorist who does not take democracy to be an end in itself (regardless of its consequences) should be concerned about Converse's findings.},

However, there has been little attention given to the potential feedback between these forces. In this article, we investigate the role of union membership in shaping white racial attitudes. We draw upon research in history and American political development to generate a theory of interracial labor politics, in which union membership reduces racial resentment. Cross-sectional analyses consistently show that white union members have lower racial resentment and greater support for policies that benefit African Americans. More importantly, our panel analysis suggests that gaining union membership between 2010 and 2016 reduced racial resentment among white workers. The findings highlight the important role of labor unions in mass politics and, more broadly, the importance of organizational membership for political attitudes and behavior.},

It finds that Puerto Rican legislators have high levels of postmaterialism and that they order the components of the postmaterialism scale in ways similar to those of the mass publics of other countries, including those of Latin America. More important, the postmaterialist scale proves of little use in explaining the positions legislators take on a host of issues, many of which are closely associated with postmaterialism.

We use the two attributes of systems uncertainties and decision stakes to distinguish among these. Postnormal science is appropriate when either attribute is high; then the traditional methodologies are ineffective. In those circumstances, the quality assurance of scientific inputs to the policy process requires an `extended peer community', consisting of all those with a stake in the dialogue on the issue. Post-normal science can provide a path to the democratization of science, and also a response to the current tendencies to post-modernity.},

  abstract = {Science, long considered a cornerstone in shaping policy decisions, is increasingly vital in addressing contemporary societal challenges. However, it remains unclear whether science is used differently by policymakers with different partisan commitments. Here we combine large-scale datasets capturing science, policy, and their interactions, to systematically examine the partisan differences in the use of science in policy across both the federal government and ideological think tanks in the United States. We find that the use of science in policy documents has featured a roughly six-fold increase over the last 25 years, highlighting science's growing relevance in policymaking. However, the pronounced increase masks stark and systematic partisan differences in the amount, content, and character of science used in policy. Democratic-controlled congressional committees and left-leaning think tanks cite substantially more science, and more impactful science, compared to their Republican and right-leaning counterparts. Moreover, the two factions cite substantively different science, with only about 5\% of scientific papers being cited by both parties, highlighting a strikingly low degree of bipartisan engagement with scientific literature. We find that the uncovered large partisan disparities are rather universal across time, scientific fields, policy institutions, and issue areas, and are not simply driven by differing policy agendas. Probing potential mechanisms, we field an original survey of over 3,000 political elites and policymakers, finding substantial partisan differences in trust toward scientists and scientific institutions, potentially contributing to the observed disparities in science use. Overall, amidst rising political polarization and science's increasingly critical role in informing policy, this paper uncovers systematic partisan disparities in the use and trust of science, which may have wide-ranging implications for science and society at large.},

According to previous literature, anxiety motivates citizens to learn and pay more attention to news coverage. Literature in psychology demonstrates that anxiety is associated with a tendency to pay closer attention to threatening information. We predict that anxious citizens will seek more information but that they will seek out and be attracted to threatening information. In an experiment, we induce anxiety about immigration and then subjects have the opportunity to search for additional information in a website designed to mimic online news sources. The website has both immigration and nonimmigration stories, and the immigration stories are split between threatening coverage and nonthreatening coverage. We find that anxious subjects exhibit biased information processing; they read, remember, and agree with threatening information.},

  abstract = {Open political debate on immigration and integration policies (IIP) among Canadian political parties has been relatively limited. As Canada's immigration and integration systems become more decentralized, what about political debates about IIP in Canadian provinces? This article examines how IIP evolved across time by focusing on political parties' claims, frames and pledges in party platforms and newspapers, using the cases of Ontario and Quebec. In Ontario, IIP were primarily framed as an economic and social resource. However, following the event of 9/11, new frames began to be introduced, contributing to a heightened salience and polarization. In contrast to Quebec, however, this politicization was not sustained. In Quebec, IIP were only marginally a matter of debate until the mid-2000s. This changed following the H{\'e}rouxville event, as these topics became salient, and dominant frames of immigration as economic and social resources were challenged by those of immigration as economic and cultural threats., R{\'e}sum{\'e}Le d{\'e}bat politique ouvert sur les politiques d'immigration et d'int{\'e}gration (PII) au sein des partis politiques canadiens a {\'e}t{\'e} relativement limit{\'e}.

Despite progress, the links between researchers from these two fields develop only slowly. Divergences between the approach of political science to public policy and the expectations that public health can have about the role of political science, are often seen as an obstacle to collaboration between experts in these two areas. Thus, promising and practical research avenues are proposed along with strategies to strengthen and develop them. Considering the interdisciplinary and intersectoral nature of population health, it is important to create a critical mass of researchers interested in the health of populations and in healthy public policy that can thrive working at the junction of political science and public health.},

  abstract = {In recent decades, a `realist' alternative to ideal theories of politics has slowly taken shape. Bringing together philosophers, political theorists, and political scientists, this countermovement seeks to reframe inquiry into politics and political norms. Among the hallmarks of this endeavor are a moral psychology that includes the passions and emotions; a robust conception of political possibility and rejection of utopian thinking; the belief that political conflict --- of values as well as interests --- is both fundamental and ineradicable; a focus on institutions as the arenas within which conflict is mediated and contained; and a conception of politics as a sphere of activity that is distinct, autonomous, and subject to norms that cannot be derived from individual morality. For political realists, a `well-ordered society' is rarely attainable; a modus vivendi without agreement on first principles is often the only practical possibility. Not only will `full compliance' never be achieved, but also it is an assumption that yields misleading accounts of political norms. While realists offer a number of compelling criticisms of ideal theory, there are some lacunae in their stance. It is not yet clear whether realism constitutes a coherent affirmative alternative to idealism. Nor have realists clarified the extent of conflict that is consistent with political order as such. And because both sides accept `ought implies can' as a constraint on the validity of political norms, much of the debate between realists and idealists revolves around deep empirical disagreements that are yet to be clarified.},

  abstract = {Abstract We examine how local newspaper closures affect public finance outcomes for local governments. Following a newspaper closure, municipal borrowing costs increase by 5--11 basis points, costing the municipality an additional \$650,000 per issue. This effect is causal and not driven by underlying economic conditions. The loss of government monitoring resulting from a closure is associated with higher government wages and deficits and increased likelihoods of costly advance refundings and negotiated sales. Overall, our results indicate that local newspapers hold their governments accountable, keeping municipal borrowing costs low and ultimately saving local taxpayers money.},

Therefore, it is a major concern for health policy makers to understand the drivers of innovation processes. This paper focuses on the differences in behaviour of managers and front-line employees in the pro-innovative provision of public health services. Methods We utilize a survey conducted on front-line employees and managers in public health institutions across six European countries. The survey covers topics related to satisfaction, or attitude towards innovation or their institution. We undertake principal components analysis and analysis of variance, and estimate a multinomial ordered probit model to analyse the existence of different behaviour in managers and front-line employees with respect to innovation. Results Perception of innovation is different for managers and front-line employees in public health institutions. While front-line employees' attitude depends mostly on the overall performance of the institution, managers feel more involved and motivated, and their behaviour depends more on individual and organisational innovative profiles. Conclusion It becomes crucial to make both managers and front-line employees at public health institutions feel participative and motivated in order to maximise the benefits of technical or organisational innovative process in the health services provision.},

The changing role of political leaders in contemporary democracies is assessed through a perspective aimed at linking leadership theory and political science. One of the major consequences of the personalization of politics seems to lie in the changing expectations of voters with respect to the personal profile of their leaders. This is due to the lowering effects of television and parallel attempts by leaders to appeal voters on the basis of perceived similarities. As to the leaders' effect on individual voting behavior, we highlight the various reasons that can enhance (or constrain) the role of party leaders' image in the voting calculus. Implications and directions for further research are discussed in the concluding section. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

This trade destruction provides some evidence that the massive 1989-93 Canadian job losses were not primarily caused by the FTA.

These events made it clear to us that the GCIU is acting in concert with the CEP, (which represents our striking editorial workers and has maintained a profound ideological opposition to this newspaper and its ownership) to bring pressure on the company to cede to the CEP position on seniority and other items central to that dispute.

The suggestion that everyone in our editorial department is unhappy or resists this change is untrue. Many of our journalists readily embraced the new direction. Twenty or so courageously crossed the picket lines on the first day of this strike to stand up for it with us and there are many who have chosen not to picket. Others, I would suggest, are on the picket line only because they face enormous pressures. Another 500 employees here in other departments are also working diligently through this process.},

  abstract = {The Nazis never won a majority in free elections, but soon after Hitler took power most people turned away from democracy and backed the Nazi regime. Hitler won growing support even as he established the secret police (Gestapo) and concentration camps. What has been in dispute for over fifty years is what the Germans knew about these camps, and in what ways were they involved in the persecution of 'race enemies', slave workers, and socialoutsiders.To answer these questions, and to explore the public sides of Nazi persecution, Robert Gellately has consulted an array of primary documents. He argues that the Nazis did not cloak their radical approaches to 'law and order' in utter secrecy, but played them up in the press and loudly proclaimed the superiority of their system over all others. They publicized their views by drawing on popular images, cherished German ideals, and long held phobias, and were able to win over converts to theircause. The author traces the story from 1933, and shows how war and especially the prospect of defeat radicalized Nazism. As the country spiralled toward defeat, Germans for the most part held on stubbornly. For anyone who contemplated surrender or resistance, terror became the order of theday.},

Cyclophosphamide pretreated BALB/c mice were induced by topical treatment of the dorsal skin surface on 3 consecutive days and challenged on the ears 5 days after the last induction. For each induction and challenge treatment, mice were consecutively irradiated with ultraviolet (UV) A (10 J/cm2) and UVB (45 mJ/cm2) radiation 30 min to 1 hr after test material application. The photoallergic response to musk ambrette, a known human photoallergen, was significantly augmented when three consecutive induction exposures were used as compared with one or two inductions. The photoallergic potential of nine other known human photoallergens (tetrachlorosalicylanilide, bithionol, 6-methylcoumarin, chlorpromazine, sodium omadine, bisphenol A, sulphanilamide, fentichlor and p-aminobenzoic acid) was successfully detected using the mouse model. In each experiment, the ear thickness changes observed in the photoallergy test mice were significantly greater than the changes observed in the contact allergy, vehicle/radiation and phototoxicity control mice. Coumarin and homosalate, two agents not traditionally associated with causing photoallergy in humans or animals, did not demonstrate contact photoallergy using this model. With three of the photoallergens, musk ambrette, bithionol and tetrachlorosalicylanilide, the ear swelling response obtained was due to photoallergy alone and not due to the co-existence of both contact photoallergy and contact allergy. In addition, irradiating mice 24 hr, rather than 1 hr, following application of the test material during the induction phase resulted in a significantly reduced photoallergic response with both musk ambrette and tetrachlorosalicylanilide. These results indicate that the mouse ear-swelling model is a potentially useful model for investigative and predictive photoallergy testing.},

The model further implies that susceptibility to partisan change declines with age. The significance of Achen's model for the study of party identification leads us to examine more closely its underlying assumptions and the empirical ramifications of this and other learning models. Method: This essay develops a more general learning model, based upon the Kalman filter, that encompasses the Achen model as a special case. Results: We show that the Achen assumption of a fixed party benefit level leads to implausible implications about how voters learn from the history of party performance. When party benefit levels are allowed to vary over time, models of voter learning no longer imply that partisan attitudes, even among the older segments of the population, remain stable in the wake of new information about the parties. We conclude by discussing the empirical viability of our revised learning model and its implications for the study of partisan attitudes.},

We exploit a new database on the socioeconomic determinants of the vote, covering more than 300 elections held between 1948 and 2020. In the 1950s and 1960s, the vote for social democratic, socialist, and affiliated parties was associated with lower-educated and low-income voters. It has gradually become associated with higher-educated voters, giving rise in the 2010s to a disconnection between the effects of income and education on the vote: higher-educated voters now vote for the ``left,'' while high-income voters continue to vote for the ``right.'' This transition has been accelerated by the rise of green and anti-immigration movements, whose distinctive feature is to concentrate the votes of the higher-educated and lower-educated electorates. Combining our database with historical data on political parties' programs, we provide evidence that the reversal of the education cleavage is strongly linked to the emergence of a new ``sociocultural'' axis of political conflict.},

  abstract = {This paper studies the long-run transformation of the structure of political cleavages in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. Regional, linguistic, and religious identities inherited from nation-building processes have differentially shaped the representation of social inequalities in the former dominions. I discuss how the politics of ``old minorities'' -- Catholics of Irish descent in Australia, French speakers of Qu{\'e}bec in Canada, and the M{\=a}ori in New Zealand -- have interacted with the politics of class and the formation of electoral divides. In all three countries, higher-educated voters have become increasingly supportive of labor, social democratic, liberal, and green parties, while high-income voters have remained more likely to vote for conservative forces, leading to the emergence of ``multi-elite party systems'' comparable to that found in other Western democracies. Nonetheless, nativist cleavages remain more limited in these democracies than in Western Europe, as illustrated by the only moderate support of immigrants and new minorities for left-wing and liberal parties.},

In the context of debates about whether the key causal factors are economic or cultural, we contend that an effective analysis must rest on understanding how economic and cultural developments interact to generate support for populism. We suggest that one way to do so is to see status anxiety as a proximate factor inducing support for populism, and economic and cultural developments as factors that combine to precipitate such anxiety. Using cross-national survey data from 20 developed democracies, we assess the viability of this approach. We show that lower levels of subjective social status are associated with support for right populist parties, identify a set of economic and cultural developments likely to have depressed the social status of men without a college education, and show that the relative social status of those men has declined since 1987 in many of the developed democracies. We conclude that status effects provide one pathway through which economic and cultural developments may combine to increase support for the populist right.},

It describes the electoral gender gap in a longitudinal cross-national design (1974--2000, 12 countries) with EuroBarometer data. The analysis shows that gender differences in voting in Europe follow a similar movement to what has been described for the USA. Women tended to vote more for conservative parties in the 1970s, while in the new millennium they have given higher support to left parties. The speed of this development differs cross-nationally and not all countries reached the state of a modern gender gap (where women lean left). At the national level the driving force for the emergence of a modern gender gap is mainly increased levels of female labor participation. At the individual level structural variables explain traditional gender differences in voting, but fail to account for the gender gap in recent years.},

Using a sample of 2,382 tweets, we demonstrate that ChatGPT outperforms crowd-workers for several annotation tasks, including relevance, stance, topics, and frames detection. Specifically, the zero-shot accuracy of ChatGPT exceeds that of crowd-workers for four out of five tasks, while ChatGPT's intercoder agreement exceeds that of both crowd-workers and trained annotators for all tasks. Moreover, the per-annotation cost of ChatGPT is less than \$0.003 -- about twenty times cheaper than MTurk.

  abstract = {If human social anxiety is not predominately about the fear of physical injury or attack, as it is in other animals, then, to understand human social anxiety (i.e., fear of evaluation), it is necessary to consider why certain types of relationships are so important. Why do humans need to court the good feelings of others and fear not doing so? And why, when people wish to appear attractive to others (e.g., to make friends, date a desired sexual partner, or give a good presentation), do some people become so overwhelmed with anxiety that they behave submissively and fearfully (which can be seen as unattractive) or are avoidant? This article has suggested that humans have evolved to compete for attractiveness to make good impressions because these are related to eliciting important social resources and investments from others. These, in turn, have been linked to inclusive fitness and have physiological regulating effects. Being allocated a low social rank or ostracized carries many negative consequences for controlling social resources and physiological regulation. Social anxiety, like shame, can be adaptive to the extent that it helps people to "stay on track" with what is socially acceptable and what is not and could result in social sanction and exclusion. However, dysfunctional social anxiety is the result of activation of basic defensive mechanisms (and modules for) for threat detection and response (e.g., inhibition, eye-gaze avoidance, flight, or submission) that can be recruited rapidly for dealing with immediate threats, override conscious wishes, and interfere with being seen as a "useful associate." Second, this article has suggested that socially anxious people are highly attuned to the competitive dynamics of trying to elicit approval and investment from others but that they perceive themselves to start from an inferior (i.e., low-rank) position and, because of this, activate submissive defensives when attempting to present themselves as confident, able, and attractive to others. These submissive defenses (which evolved to inhibit animals in low-rank positions from making claims on resources or up-rank bids) interfere with confident performance, leading to a failure cycle. While psychological therapies may target specific modules, cognitions, and behaviors (e.g., damage limitation behaviors, eyes gaze avoidance, theory of mind beliefs) that underpin social anxiety, drugs may work by having a more generalized effect on the threat-safety balance such that there is a different "weighting" given to various social threats and opportunities. If social anxiety (and disorders associated with it) are increasing in the modern age, one reason may be invigorated competition for social prestige, attractiveness, and resources.},

For many global wildlife populations, however, insufficient scientific information exists, and alternative data sources may need to be considered in management decisions. In some circumstances, local ecological knowledge (LEK) can serve as a useful, complementary data source, and may be particularly valuable when managing wildlife populations that occur in remote locations inhabited by indigenous peoples. Although several published papers discuss the general benefits of LEK, few attempt to examine the reliability of information generated through this approach. We review four case studies of marine birds in which we gathered LEK for each species and then compared this information to empirical data derived from independent scientific studies of the same populations. We then discuss how we attempted to integrate LEK into our own conservation and management efforts of these bird species with variable success. Although LEK proved to be a useful source of information for three of four species, we conclude that management decisions based primarily on LEK, in the absence of scientific scrutiny, should be treated with caution.},

The analysis emphasizes the impact of the immigration issue on the vote for the radical right. Logit and regression analysis are used to determine what can be explained by structural, situational, and political factors versus gender alone in France, Germany, and Austria. It is found that there is a gender gap, but it varies across the three cases; that attitudes toward political issues, particularly immigration, have a disproportionate impact on the probability of voting radical right but not on the gender gap specifically; and that there is a difference between men and women on the immigration issue, and blue-collar workers are more likely to be anti-immigrant than those in other sectors.},

  abstract = {Abstract. This study analyses legislative voting in the first ten Canadian Parliaments (1867--1908). The results demonstrate that party unity in the House of Commons dramatically increased over time. From the comparative literature on legislative organization, we identify three factors to explain this trend: partisan sorting, electoral incentives and negative agenda control. Our empirical analysis shows that intraparty conflict is primarily explained by the opposition between Anglo-Celtic/Protestants and French/Catholic members of Parliament. Once lawmakers sort into parties according to their religious affiliations, we observe a sharp increase in voting unity within the Liberal and Conservative caucuses. Ultimately, our results highlight the importance of territorial and socio-cultural conflicts, as well as agenda control, in explaining the emergence of parties as cohesive voting groups in the House of Commons.R{\'e}sum{\'e}.

Using Poole's (2005) optimal classification algorithm, we locate MPs and their parties in a two-dimensional geometric model. The first dimension represents the division between governing and opposition parties that has been found in similar parliamentary systems. The second dimension captures the opposition between the Bloc Qu{\'e}b{\'e}cois and the rest of the legislature. We find a clear separation between the Reform party (and later the Conservative party) and the Bloc Qu{\'e}b{\'e}cois in the 35th and 38th Parliaments, with the Liberal and the New Democratic parties occupying the centre. However, in the 39th Parliament, the ordering changes with the Conservatives and the New Democrats near the centre, and Liberal and Bloc MPs occupying the extremes. We explain this change by the capacity of the governing party to control the legislative agenda and the recent minority governments in the House of Commons.

La premi{\`e}re dimension repr{\'e}sente le conflit entre le gouvernement et les partis d'opposition que l'on retrouve {\'e}galement dans d'autres syst{\`e}mes parlementaires, alors que la seconde dimension correspond {\`a} l'opposition r{\'e}gionale qui existe entre le Bloc Qu{\'e}b{\'e}cois et les partis f{\'e}d{\'e}raux.

Overall, we find that partisan sorting and the government's ability to control the agenda are central to the consolidation of parties over time.

Yet despite this shift, public health research and practice continue to privilege individual- and interpersonal-level measurements and interventions. Rather than adapting public health practice to social ecological theory, the field has layered new concepts (``root causes,'' ``social determinants'') onto a biomedical paradigm---attempting to answer questions presented by the social ecological schema with practices developed in response to biomedicine. This stymies health equity work before it begins---limiting the field's ability to broaden conceptions of well-being, redress histories of inequitable knowledge valuation, and advance systems-level change. To respond effectively to our knowledge of social determinants, public health must resolve the ongoing disconnect between social ecological theory and biomedically-driven practice. To that end, this article issues a clarion call to complete the shift from a biomedical to a social ecological paradigm, and provides a basis for moving theory into practice. It examines biomedicine's foundations and limitations, glosses existing critiques of the paradigm, and describes health equity challenges presented by over-reliance on conventional practices. It then offers theoretical and epistemological direction for developing innovative social ecological strategies that advance health equity.},

The gap between rich and poor has never been wider{\dots}legislative stalemate paralyzes the country{\dots}corporations resist federal regulations{\dots}spectacular mergers produce giant companies{\dots}the influence of money in politics deepens{\dots}bombs explode in crowded streets{\dots}small wars proliferate far from our shores{\dots}a dizzying array of inventions speeds the pace of daily life. These unnervingly familiar headlines serve as the backdrop for Doris Kearns Goodwin's highly anticipated The Bully Pulpit---a dynamic history of the first decade of the Progressive era, that tumultuous time when the nation was coming unseamed and reform was in the air. The story is told through the intense friendship of Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft---a close relationship that strengthens both men before it ruptures in 1912, when they engage in a brutal fight for the presidential nomination that divides their wives, their children, and their closest friends, while crippling the progressive wing of the Republican Party, causing Democrat Woodrow Wilson to be elected, and changing the country's history. The Bully Pulpit is also the story of the muckraking press, which arouses the spirit of reform that helps Roosevelt push the government to shed its laissez-faire attitude toward robber barons, corrupt politicians, and corporate exploiters of our natural resources. The muckrakers are portrayed through the greatest group of journalists ever assembled at one magazine---Ida Tarbell, Ray Stannard Baker, Lincoln Steffens, and William Allen White---teamed under the mercurial genius of publisher S. S. McClure. Goodwin's narrative is founded upon a wealth of primary materials. The correspondence of more than four hundred letters between Roosevelt and Taft begins in their early thirties and ends only months before Roosevelt's death. Edith Roosevelt and Nellie Taft kept diaries. The muckrakers wrote hundreds of letters to one another, kept journals, and wrote their memoirs. The letters of Captain Archie Butt, who served as a personal aide to both Roosevelt and Taft, provide an intimate view of both men. The Bully Pulpit, like Goodwin's brilliant chronicles of the Civil War and World War II, exquisitely demonstrates her distinctive ability to combine scholarly rigor with accessibility. It is a major work of history---an examination of leadership in a rare moment of activism and reform that brought the country closer to its founding ideals.},

The public vote to leave the European Union (EU)---for a `Brexit'---brought an end to the country's membership of the EU and set it on a fundamentally different course. Recent academic research on the vote for Brexit points to the importance of immigration as a key driver, although how immigration influenced the vote remains unclear. In this article, we draw on aggregate-level data and individual-level survey data from the British Election Study (BES) to explore how immigration shaped public support for Brexit. Our findings suggest that, specifically, increases in the rate of immigration at the local level and sentiments regarding control over immigration were key predictors of the vote for Brexit, even after accounting for factors stressed by established theories of Eurosceptic voting. Our findings suggest that a large reservoir of support for leaving the EU, and perhaps anti-immigration populism more widely, will remain in Britain, so long as immigration remains a salient issue.},

This emerging research area lies at the crossroads of marketing and political science, but these fields have developed largely independent of one another with little cross-fertilization of ideas. We discuss recent theoretical, empirical, and behavioral work on political campaigns, integrating perspectives from marketing and political science. Our focus is on (1) the extent to which paradigms used in goods and services marketing carry over to the institutional setting of political campaigns, (2) what changes are necessary in models and methodology to understand issues in political marketing and voter behavior, and (3) how the special setting of politics may help us gain a better understanding of certain topics central to marketing such as advertising, branding, and social networks.},

  abstract = {We believe that punctuational change dominates the history of life: evolution is concentrated in very rapid events of speciation (geologically instantaneous, even if tolerably continuous in ecological time). Most species, during their geological history, either do not change in any appreciable way, or else they fluctuate mildly in morphology, with no apparent direction. Phyletic gradualism is very rare and too slow, in any case, to produce the major events of evolution. Evolutionary trends are not the product of slow, directional transformation within lineages; they represent the differential success of certain species within a clade-speciation may be random with respect to the direction of a trend (Wright's rule). As an a priori bias, phyletic gradualism has precluded any fair assessment of evolutionary tempos and modes. It could not be refuted by empirical catalogues constructed in its light because it excluded contrary information as the artificial result of an imperfect fossil record. With the model of punctuated equilibria, an unbiased distribution of evolutionary tempos can be established by treating stasis as data and by recording the pattern of change for all species in an assemblage. This distribution of tempos can lead to strong inferences about modes. If, as we predict, the punctuational tempo is prevalent, then speciation-not phyletic evolution-must be the dominant mode of evolution. We argue that virtually none of the examples brought forward to refute our model can stand as support for phyletic gradualism; many are so weak and ambiguous that they only reflect the persistent bias for gradualism still deeply embedded in paleontological thought. Of the few stronger cases, we concentrate on Gingerich's data for Hyopsodus and argue that it provides an excellent example of species selection under our model. We then review the data of several studies that have supported our model since we published it five years ago. The record of human evolution seems to provide a particularly good example: no gradualism has been detected within any hominid taxon, and many are long-ranging; the trend to larger brains arises from differential success of essentially static taxa. The data of molecular genetics support our assumption that large genetic changes often accompany the process of speciation. Phyletic gradualism was an a priori assertion from the start-it was never "seen" in the rocks; it expressed the cultural and political biases of 19th century liberalism. Huxley advised Darwin to eschew it as an "unnecessary difficulty." We think that it has now become an empirical fallacy. A punctuational view of change may have wide validity at all levels of evolutionary processes. At the very least, it deserves consideration as an alternate way of interpreting the history of life.}

In our view, a satisfactory theory of democracy would focus normatively on the social identities and political interests of citizens rather than on their expressed policy preferences, and empirically on the ability of organized or attentive groups to get those identities and interests effectively recognized and acted on in the governmental process. A group-theoretic version of democratic theory along these lines would dispense with the most important illusions of the conventional ``folk theory'' of democracy. However, much hard work remains to clarify how actual democracies make policy and to construct a wise normative standard---inspirational but not innocent---against which they can be judged.},

Effective use of citizens' political talents therefore requires limiting public surveillance and advice to broad overview aspects, rather than to micro-management.

Contributors include economists, sociologists, philosophers, and political scientists, and the discussion ranges from frameworks for thinking about inequality, to original analyses using Canadian data, to assessments of significant policy issues, methodologies, and research directions. What emerges is the most detailed picture of inequality in Canada to date and, disturbingly, one that shows signs of us becoming a less just society. An invaluable source of information for policy makers, researchers, and students from a broad variety of disciplines, Dimensions of Inequality in Canada will also appeal to readers interested or involved in public debates over inequality.},

Green and Ian Shapiro assess rational choice theory where it is reputed to be most successful: the study of collective action, the behavior of political parties and politicians, and such phenomena as voting cycles and Prisoner's Dilemmas. In their hard-hitting critique, Green and Shapiro demonstrate that the much-heralded achievements of rational choice theory are in fact deeply suspect and that fundamental rethinking is needed if rational choice theorists are to contribute to the understanding of politics. Green and Shapiro show that empirical tests of rational choice theories are marred by a series of methodological defects. These defects flow from the characteristic rational choice impulse to defend universal theories of politics. As a result, many tests are so poorly conducted as to be irrelevant to evaluating rational choice models. Tests that are properly conducted either tend to undermine rational choice theories or to lend support for propositions that are banal. Green and Shapiro offer numerous suggestions as to how rational choice propositions might be reformulated as parts of testable hypotheses for the study of politics. In a final chapter they anticipate and respond to a variety of rational choice counterarguments, thereby initiating a dialogue that is bound to continue for some time.},

Green theorists argue for a difference in kind between the two domains, whereas survey researchers identify a difference in degree, as they carefully extend environmental scales to incrementally include ecological items. Eckersley's (1992) theory of green political thought identifies resource conservation, human welfare ecology, preservationism, and animal liberation as subtypes of anthropocentrism; and it identifies transpersonal ecology, autopoietic intrinsic value, and ecofeminism as subtypes of ecocentrism. The empirical results of testing Eckersley's framework indicate that the subtypes cannot be coherently subsumed under a general green dimension but that anthropocentrism and ecocentrism, to a large degree, are independent of one another. Young age and high education are inversely related to ecocentrism. This contradicts previous research on environmental concern.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses speeding, that is, ``too fast'' responses, in web surveys. Relying on the response process model, we argue that very short response times indicate low data quality, stemming from a lack of attention on the part of respondents. To identify speeding, prior research employed case-wise procedures. Using data from nine online surveys, we demonstrate that response behavior of individual respondents varies considerably during a survey. Thus, we use case- and page-wise procedures to capture speeding behavior that taps different, although related, phenomena. Moreover, page-specific speeding measures capture aspects of data quality that traditional quality measures do not cover. Employing both page-specific and case-wise speeding measures, we examine whether removing speeders makes a difference in substantive findings. The evidence indicates that removing ``too fast'' responses does not alter marginal distributions, irrespective of which speeder-correction technique is employed. Moreover, explanatory models yield, by and large, negligible coefficient differences (on average about one standard error). Only in exceptional cases differences exceed two standard errors. Our findings suggest that speeding primarily adds some random noise to the data and attenuate correlations, if it makes a difference at all. The paper concludes by discussing implications and limitations.},

Scholars have long recognized this, but the massive costs of analyzing even moderately sized collections of texts have hindered their use in political science research. Here lies the promise of automated text analysis: it substantially reduces the costs of analyzing large collections of text. We provide a guide to this exciting new area of research and show how, in many instances, the methods have already obtained part of their promise. But there are pitfalls to using automated methods--they are no substitute for careful thought and close reading and require extensive and problem-specific validation. We survey a wide range of new methods, provide guidance on how to validate the output of the models, and clarify misconceptions and errors in the literature. To conclude, we argue that for automated text methods to become a standard tool for political scientists, methodologists must contribute new methods and new methods of validation.},

This fact is surprising given studies that emphasize ``activation'' of racial conservatism in 2016---the increased relationship between vote choice and racial attitudes among voters. But this relationship provides almost no information about how many votes candidates receive from individuals with particular attitudes. To understand how many votes a voting bloc contributes to a candidate's total, we must also consider a bloc's size and its turnout rate. Taking these into account, we find that Trump's most significant gains came from whites with moderate attitudes about race and immigration. Trump's vote totals improved the most among swing voters: low-socioeconomic status whites who are political moderates. Our analysis demonstrates that focusing only on vote choice is insufficient to explain sources of candidate support in the electorate.},

We argue that buying such products can be construed as altruistic, since green products often cost more and are of lower quality than their conventional counterparts, but green goods benefit the environment for everyone. Because biologists have observed that altruism might function as a ``costly signal'' associated with status, we examined in 3 experiments how status motives influenced desire for green products. Activating status motives led people to choose green products over more luxurious nongreen products. Supporting the notion that altruism signals one's willingness and ability to incur costs for others' benefit, status motives increased desire for green products when shopping in public (but not private) and when green products cost more (but not less) than nongreen products. Findings suggest that status competition can be used to promote proenvironmental behavior. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Bisphenol A (BPA) is a high volume chemical used in a wide variety of products, including plastic bottles and canned goods. Based on widespread human exposure and endocrine effects observed first in animal studies and now in humans, this chemical is being extensively studied. Most physicians have not had formal teaching regarding human risks from environmental exposures such as BPA. This article aims to provide: 1) a basis for learning about BPA as an environmental exposure and 2) practical advice for healthcare providers to share with concerned families. RECENT FINDINGS: Human exposure to BPA is nearly universal. Animal studies have documented a variety of endocrine effects of this chemical and recent studies involving humans are resulting in growing concerns. These studies suggest that increased exposure to BPA is correlated with diseases such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Based on the metabolism of BPA and its endocrine effects, scientists hypothesize that the impact on children will be magnified. Further studies are needed to clarify this issue; funding has increased dramatically in recent years and scientists are hopeful that many of the currently unanswered questions will be addressed. SUMMARY: The evidence for harmful health effects on humans from BPA exposure is incomplete, but is sufficient to suggest that limiting exposure is warranted. Further studies involving pregnant women and young children are needed to clarify the endocrine effects of BPA on this vulnerable population.},

Why do Democratic politicians propose an array of different policies to match the diversity of their supporters, only to become mired in stark demographic divisions over issue priorities? In short, why do the two parties act so differently-whether in the electorate, on the campaign trail, or in public office? Asymmetric Politics offers a comprehensive explanation: The Republican Party is the vehicle of an ideological movement while the Democratic Party is a coalition of social groups. Republican leaders prize conservatism and attract support by pledging loyalty to broad values. Democratic leaders instead seek concrete government action, appealing to voters' group identities and interests by endorsing specific policies. This fresh and comprehensive investigation reveals how Democrats and Republicans think differently about politics, rely on distinct sources of information, argue past one another, and pursue divergent goals in government. It provides a rigorous new understanding of contemporary polarization and governing dysfunction while demonstrating how longstanding features of American politics and public policy reflect our asymmetric party system.},

Recent empirical findings illustrate cases when the linkage between nonresponse rates and nonresponse biases is absent. Despite this, professional standards continue to urge high response rates. Statistical expressions of nonresponse bias can be translated into causal models to guide hypotheses about when nonresponse causes bias. Alternative designs to measure nonresponse bias exist, providing different but incomplete information about the nature of the bias. A synthesis of research studies estimating nonresponse bias shows the bias often present. A logical question at this moment in history is what advantage probability sample surveys have if they suffer from high nonresponse rates. Since postsurvey adjustment for nonresponse requires auxiliary variables, the answer depends on the nature of the design and the quality of the auxiliary variables.},

Here we report results from a randomized longitudinal field experiment embedded in a nationally representative online panel survey ( {$N$}  = 1,037) in which participants were incentivized to change their browser default settings and social media following patterns, boosting the likelihood of encountering news with either a left-leaning (HuffPost) or right-leaning (Fox News) slant during the 2018 US midterm election campaign. Data on  {$\approx$}  19 million web visits by respondents indicate that resulting changes in news consumption persisted for at least 8 wk. Greater exposure to partisan news can cause immediate but short-lived increases in website visits and knowledge of recent events. After adjusting for multiple comparisons, however, we find little evidence of a direct impact on opinions or affect. Still, results from later survey waves suggest that both treatments produce a lasting and meaningful decrease in trust in the mainstream media up to 1 y later. Consistent with the minimal-effects tradition, direct consequences of online partisan media are limited, although our findings raise questions about the possibility of subtle, cumulative dynamics. The combination of experimentation and computational social science techniques illustrates a powerful approach for studying the long-term consequences of exposure to partisan news.},

  abstract = {Models of trade policy often depend on the efficient aggregation of individual preferences. While much of the recent empirical work on trade focuses on whether domestic coalitions form along class or sectoral lines, the process of preference aggregation itself remains understudied. In democratic countries, voting is typically assumed to be an unproblematic mechanism for aggregating preferences, but such an assumption may be misleading when the salience of trade policy is low or heterogeneous throughout the electorate. Using data from a survey of 36,501 potential voters in the 2006 U.S. midterm congressional elections, this article explores the salience of trade policy for voters as a whole and for populations predicted to be most affected by changing trade patterns. The article offers an estimation of trade policy salience based on the degree to which voters held Senate incumbents accountable for their 2005 vote on the Central American Free Trade Agreement, relative to roll call votes on other issues of the day. The article finds trade policy salience to be relatively low in terms of stated importance, in voters' knowledge of their representatives' policy positions, and in its effect on voters' propensity to vote for the incumbent. The low salience of trade policy, particularly among highly affected groups, calls into question voter-driven models of trade policy.},

  abstract = {The employment structure of The Netherlands and other advanced countries is evolving from industrial to postindustrial. Yet existing social class schemata, like the well-known Erikson, Goldthorpe and Portocarero (EGP) class schema, were constructed for an industrial employment structure. In this study, we adjust the EGP class schema to account for this transformation by using new class theories. We distinguish a 'new' class of social and cultural specialists and an 'old' class of technocrats with both a higher and a lower version in the service class. Our research question concerns the extent to which the adjusted EGP class schema is a better predictor of people's political orientation than the standard EGP class schema. We assume that the 'new' classes differ in their political orientation from the 'old' classes. We also assume that, during their formation, the 'new' classes become increasingly effective in explaining differences in people's political orientation. Experts' knowledge is employed to classify the occupations. In addition, we use the data of 34,856 respondents gathered between 1970 and 2003 in The Netherlands. The adjusted EGP class schema explains people's political orientation substantially better than the standard EGP class schema; the 'new' classes vote significantly more for leftist parties and differ substantially in their political orientation from the 'old' classes. Furthermore, our results show that the political orientation of the low-grade social and cultural specialists has become more crystallized since 1970.},

A typical social class should differentiate itself with respect to moral attitudes, socio-political behaviour and lifestyle forms. To reveal whether these assumed classes are indeed typical classes, we have studied a variety of socio-political, cultural and economic preferences and behaviour of members of these social classes using the Family Survey of the Dutch Population (FSDP) 1992, 1998, 2000 and 2003. To unravel the net differences between the social and cultural specialists and the technocrats, we controlled for the field of study, the level of education and background factors. Taking these control factors into consideration, the social and cultural specialists differentiate themselves substantially from the technocrats in their socio-political and especially economic preferences and behaviour. With respect to their cultural preferences and behaviour, they do not differ significantly from the technocrats.},

The ESI assesses the individual-level occurrence of substantial year-to-year declines in available household resources, accounting for fluctuations not only in income but also in out-of-pocket medical expenses. It also assesses whether those experiencing such declines have sufficient liquid financial wealth to buffer against these shocks. We find that insecurity---the share of individuals experiencing substantial resource declines without adequate financial buffers---has risen steadily since the mid-1980s for virtually all subgroups of Americans, albeit with cyclical fluctuation. At the same time, we find that there is substantial disparity in the degree to which different subgroups are exposed to economic risk. As the ESI derives from a data-independent conceptual foundation, it can be measured using different panel datasets. We find that the degree and disparity by which insecurity has risen is robust across the best available sources.},

Dionne, Jr., Washington Post), demonstrating and explaining the hidden story of growing economic insecurity. In this fully revised and updated second edition, he brings his powerful expos{\'e} of "The Great Risk Shift" up to date with startling new evidence and compelling new ideas. Hacker shows that the safety net was unraveling long before the late-2000s, as more and more economic risk shifted from the broad shoulders of government and business onto the fragile backs of American families. Whether the problem is risky jobs brought on by corporate restructuring and the "gig economy" of contingent work, risky families created by the rising costs and instabilities of parenthood, risky retirement caused by the collapse of traditional guaranteed pensions, or risky health care fueled by skyrocketing costs and unstable coverage-Hacker shows what has changed and why, the ways in which ordinary Americans have been affected, and how we can fight back. Behind the risk shift, he contends, is the "Personal Responsibility Crusade" eagerly embraced by corporate leaders and conservative politicians who speak of an economic nirvana in which Americans are free to choose. But the result, Hacker reveals, has been very different: a harsh new world of economic insecurity in which far too many Americans are allowed to fall behind. Blending powerful human stories, big-picture analysis, and compelling ideas for reform, this remarkable volume has become a rallying point in the struggle for economic security in an increasingly uncertain world.},

  abstract = {A groundbreaking account of the dangerous marriage of plutocratic economic priorities and right-wing populist appeals---and how it threatens the pillars of American democracy. The Republican Party appears to be divided between a tax-cutting old guard and a white-nationalist vanguard---and with Donald Trump's ascendance, the upstarts seem to be winning. Yet how are we to explain that, under Trump, the plutocrats have gotten almost everything they want, including a huge tax cut for corporations and the wealthy, regulation-killing executive actions, and a legion of business-friendly federal judges? Does the GOP represent ``forgotten'' Americans? Or does it represent the superrich? In Let Them Eat Tweets, best-selling political scientists Jacob S. Hacker and Paul Pierson offer a definitive answer: the Republican Party serves its plutocratic masters to a degree without precedent in modern global history. Conservative parties, by their nature, almost always side with the rich. But when faced with popular resistance, they usually make concessions, allowing some policies that benefit the working and middle classes. After all, how can a political party maintain power in a democracy if it serves only the interests of a narrow and wealthy slice of society? Today's Republicans have shown the way, doubling down on a truly radical, elite-benefiting economic agenda while at the same time making increasingly incendiary racial and cultural appeals to their almost entirely white base. Telling a forty-year story, Hacker and Pierson demonstrate that since the early 1980s, when inequality started spiking, extreme tax cutting, union busting, and deregulation have gone hand in hand with extreme race-baiting, outrage stoking, and disinformation. Instead of responding to the real challenges facing voters, the Republican Party offers division and distraction---most prominently, in the racist, nativist bile of the president's Twitter feed. As Hacker and Pierson argue, Trump isn't a break with the GOP's recent past. On the contrary, he embodies its tightening embrace of plutocracy and right-wing extremism---a dynamic Hacker and Pierson call ``plutocratic populism.'' As Trump and his far-right allies spew hatred and lies, Republicans in Congress and in statehouses attack social programs and funnel more and more money to the top 0.1 percent of Americans. Far from being at war with each other, reactionary plutocrats and right-wing populists have become the two faces of a party that now actively undermines democracy to achieve its goals against the will of the majority of Americans. Drawing on decades of research, Hacker and Pierson authoritatively explain the doom loop of tax cutting and fearmongering that characterizes our era---and reveal how we can fight back.},

  abstract = {In Canada in the past decade, there has been growing concern about the independence and diversity of newspaper journalism, in the wake of accelerated press concentration, convergence between previously separate media industries, the intensification of commercial bottom-line pressures, and the emergence of press barons (first Conrad Black, then the Asper family) with a willingness to use their media properties to amplify their own explicitly right-wing politics. Yet there has been little recent systematic effort to specify the nature and extent of corporate influences on Canada's press. That gap led Donald Gutstein and Robert Hackett at Simon Fraser University to agree in 1993 to inaugurate and co-direct NewsWatch Canada, a media-monitoring project originally inspired by Project Censored in the United States. Drawing from Shoemaker and Reese's hierarchical model of influence on media content, this paper summarizes content analyses by NewsWatch Canada on the following different dimensions of potential corporate influence on Canadian newspaper content: (1) the offsetting tendencies of content rationalization and duplication in chain papers; (2) newspaper coverage of their own parent companies, and of the media industry; (3) the influence of newspaper editorial positions on news coverage; (4) some potential impacts of advertising; and (5) potential double standards related to politics and social class. While the research is exploratory, there is evidence of systemic corporate influence, particularly on the second, third, and fifth dimensions.},

Levels of health concerns were directly and significantly related to positions on an index of dental health information that had been developed from questions about methods of preventing dental caries. Although expressed health concerns were not directly associated with attitudes on fluoridation, the positions of the respondents on the referendum issue were examined at three socioeconomic levels. Support for fluoridation was inversely related to increasing socioeconomic status. Moreover, persons at low socioeconomic levels with numerous health concerns favored fluoridation, but high-status respondents with strong health concerns were undecided about the issue. Perhaps this relationship was influenced by perceived disagreements about the merits of fluoridation and by different evaluations of the costs and benefits of the program.},

  abstract = {Past research has emphasized two critical economic concerns that appear to generate anti-immigrant sentiment among native citizens: concerns about labor market competition and concerns about the fiscal burden on public services. We provide direct tests of both models of attitude formation using an original survey experiment embedded in a nationwide U.S. survey. The labor market competition model predicts that natives will be most opposed to immigrants who have skill levels similar to their own. We find instead that both low-skilled and highly skilled natives strongly prefer highly skilled immigrants over low-skilled immigrants, and this preference is not decreasing in natives' skill levels. The fiscal burden model anticipates that rich natives oppose low-skilled immigration more than poor natives, and that this gap is larger in states with greater fiscal exposure (in terms of immigrant access to public services). We find instead that rich and poor natives are equally opposed to low-skilled immigration in general. In states with high fiscal exposure, poor (rich) natives are more (less) opposed to low-skilled immigration than they are elsewhere. This indicates that concerns among poor natives about constraints on welfare benefits as a result of immigration are more relevant than concerns among the rich about increased taxes. Overall the results suggest that economic self-interest, at least as currently theorized, does not explain voter attitudes toward immigration. The results are consistent with alternative arguments emphasizing noneconomic concerns associated with ethnocentrism or sociotropic considerations about how the local economy as a whole may be affected by immigration.},

  abstract = {Multiplicative interaction models are widely used in social science to examine whether the relationship between an outcome and an independent variable changes with a moderating variable. Current empirical practice tends to overlook two important problems. First, these models assume a linear interaction effect that changes at a constant rate with the moderator. Second, estimates of the conditional effects of the independent variable can be misleading if there is a lack of common support of the moderator. Replicating 46 interaction effects from 22 recent publications in five top political science journals, we find that these core assumptions often fail in practice, suggesting that a large portion of findings across all political science subfields based on interaction models are fragile and model dependent. We propose a checklist of simple diagnostics to assess the validity of these assumptions and offer flexible estimation strategies that allow for nonlinear interaction effects and safeguard against excessive extrapolation. These statistical routines are available in both R and STATA.},

This research has developed from two theoretical foundations, one grounded in political economy, the other in political psychology. These two literatures have developed largely in isolation from one another, yet the conclusions that emerge from each are strikingly similar. Consistently, immigration attitudes show little evidence of being strongly correlated with personal economic circumstances. Instead, research finds that immigration attitudes are shaped by sociotropic concerns about its cultural impacts---and to a lesser extent its economic impacts---on the nation as a whole. This pattern of results has held up as scholars have increasingly turned to experimental tests, and it holds for the United States, Canada, and Western Europe. Still, more work is needed to strengthen the causal identification of sociotropic concerns and to isolate precisely how, when, and why they matter for attitude formation.},

However, there is a paucity of research on the external validity of these methods that examines whether the determinants that explain hypothetical choices made by survey respondents match the determinants that explain what subjects actually do when making similar choices in real-world situations. This study compares results from conjoint and vignette analyses on which immigrant attributes generate support for naturalization with closely corresponding behavioral data from a natural experiment in Switzerland, where some municipalities used referendums to decide on the citizenship applications of foreign residents. Using a representative sample from the same population and the official descriptions of applicant characteristics that voters received before each referendum as a behavioral benchmark, we find that the effects of the applicant attributes estimated from the survey experiments perform remarkably well in recovering the effects of the same attributes in the behavioral benchmark. We also find important differences in the relative performances of the different designs. Overall, the paired conjoint design, where respondents evaluate two immigrants side by side, comes closest to the behavioral benchmark; on average, its estimates are within 2\% percentage points of the effects in the behavioral benchmark.},

  abstract = {What are the most fundamental differences among the political economies of the developed world? How do national institutional differences condition economic performance, public policy, and social well-being? Will they survive the pressures for convergence generated by globalization and technological change? These have long been central questions in comparative political economy. This book provides a new and coherent set of answers to them. Building on the new economics of organization, the authors develop an important new theory about which differences among national political economies are most significant for economic policy and performance. Drawing on a distinction between 'liberal' and 'coordinated' market economies, they argue that there is more than one path to economic success. Nations need not converge to a single Anglo-American model. They develop a new theory of 'comparative institutionaladvantage' that transforms our understanding of international trade, offers new explanations for the response of firms and nations to the challenges of globalization, and provides a new theory of national interest to explain the conduct of nations in international relations. The analysis brings the firm back into the centre of comparative political economy. It provides new perspectives on economic and social policy-making that illuminate the role of business in the development of the welfare state and the dilemmas facing those who make economic policy in the contemporary world. Emphasizing the 'institutional complementarities' that link labour relations, corporate finance, and national legal systems, the authors bring interdisciplinary perspectives to bear on issues of strategic management, economic performance, and institutional change. This pathbreaking work sets new agendas in the study of comparative political economy. As such, it will be of value to academics and graduate students in economics, business, and political science, as well as to many others with interests in international relations, social policy-making, and the law.},

Does supporting housing citywide but ``Not In My Back Yard'' (NIMBY) help explain why housing has become increasingly difficult to build in once affordable cities? I use two original surveys to measure how support for new housing varies between the city-scale and neighborhoodscale. Together, an exit poll of 1,660 voters during the 2015 San Francisco election and a national survey of over 3,000 respondents provide the first empirical measurements of NIMBYism at the individual-level. While homeowners are sensitive to housing's proximity, renters typically do not express NIMBYism. However, in high-rent cities, renters demonstrate NIMBYism on par with homeowners, despite continuing to support large increases in the housing supply citywide. These scale-dependent preferences not only help explain the deepening affordability crisis, but show how institutions can undersupply even widely supported public goods. When preferences are scale-dependent, the scale of decision making matters.},

Unfortunately, this has not significantly enhanced a set of fundamental problems regarding e-government. One of the problems is that the underlying democratic ideology is rarely clearly expressed. In this paper, we have therefore constructed a framework for the analysis of open government from a democratic perspective, to explore the research foundation of open government and the types of research missing. We have looked closely at the notion of democracy in peer-reviewed journals on open government from 2009 to 2013, focusing on discussions of some fundamental issues regarding democracy and the type of solutions suggested. We have found that despite seemingly good intentions and an extensive rhetoric, there is still an apparent lack of adequate tools in which public deliberation and representation are addressed in any meaningful sense. There are two main important observations herein: (i) the rhetoric in the dominant discourse supports the concept of open government formulated by the Obama administration as transparency, participation, and collaboration, but in practice, the focus is predominantly on transparency and information exchange, while ignoring fundamental democratic issues regarding participation and collaboration, and (ii) the concept of the public is inadequately considered as a homogenous entity rather than a diversified group with different interests, preferences, and abilities.},

In principley transparent institutions promote accountability and good governance. However, politicians and scholars contend that such reforms also constrain politicians' capacity to negotiate and compromise, producing inefficiency and gridlock. This argument---that transparency inhibits compromise---is widely accepted, but rarely empirically tested. We develop a theoretical framework around the claim and evaluate it in the context of American state legislatures. We leverage temporal variation in state "sunshine law" adoptions and legislative exemptions to identify the effects of transparency on several observable indicators of compromise: legislative productivity, polarization, partisanship, policy change, and budget delay. Our analyses generally do not support the argument; we mostly report precisely estimated negligible effects. Thus, transparency may not be the hindrance to policy making that conventional wisdom suggests. Effective governance appears possible in state legislatures even under public scrutiny.},

As Converse underscored, most people are grossly politically ignorant---just as they would be if, as rational-ignorance theory holds, they realized that their votes don't matter. Yet many millions of them contradict the theory by voting. This contradiction, and the illogical reasons people offer for voting, suggest that the logic of collective action does not come naturally to people (as teachers of the theory know well). To equate public ignorance with ``rational ignorance,'' then, attributes too much theoretical self-consciousness to people. Even if their ignorance is not based on a grasp of the collective-action problem, however, people's political ignorance is ``rational'': but it is less a matter of calculating the low benefit likely to flow from one vote in a sea of millions, than of encountering the much higher cost of being well informed as compared to voting. As the high cost of becoming well informed appears likely to grow, it may be advisable to move off of the political agenda issues that have no clear continuum toward which a mostly ignorant median voter may gravitate.},

  abstract = {What does it mean to "trust?" What makes us feel secure enough to place our confidence---even at times our welfare---in the hands of other people? Is it possible to "trust" an institution? What exactly do people mean when they claim to "distrust" their governments? As difficult as it may be to define, trust is essential to the formation and maintenance of a civil society. In Trust and Trustworthiness political scientist Russell Hardin addresses the standard theories of trust and articulates his own new and compelling idea: that much of what we call trust can be best described as "encapsulated interest." Research into the roles of trust in our society has offered a broad range of often conflicting theories. Some theorists maintain that trust is a social virtue that cannot be reduced to strategic self-interest; others claim that trusting another person is ultimately a rational calculation based on information about that person and his or her incentives and motivations. Hardin argues that we place our trust in persons whom we believe to have strong reasons to act in our best interests. He claims that we are correct when we assume that the main incentive of those whom we trust is to maintain a relationship with us---whether it be for reasons of economic benefit or for love and friendship. Hardin articulates his theory using examples from a broad array of personal and social relationships, paying particular attention to explanations of the development of trusting relationships. He also examines trustworthiness and seeks to understand why people may behave in ways that violate their own self-interest in order to honor commitments they have made to others. The book also draws important distinctions between vernacular uses of "trust" and "trustworthiness," contrasting, for example, the type of trust (or distrust) we place in individuals with the trust we place in institutions Trust and Trustworthiness represents the culmination of important new research into the roles of trust in our society; it offers a challenging new voice in the current discourse about the origins of cooperative behavior and its consequences for social and civic life.

Yet in advanced industrialized democracies, women tend to participate in elections as much, or more, than men do. This study addresses this puzzle by drawing on the social capital literature to help explain the paradox of voter turnout for women. Women are in fact ``rich'' in various forms of social capital, especially more informal networks of reciprocity which are often viewed as apolitical and not measured in resource models of voter turnout. Drawing on the Canadian National Survey of Giving, Volunteering, and Participating (NSGVP), the findings show that informal social capital helps explain why women turn out to vote at similar levels as men, despite having fewer traditional resources at their disposal. Hence, this study provides evidence that women's path to participation is different than men's.

In this study, we use an online survey conducted with a representative sample of Canadians to test to what extent economic and cultural cues influence support for individual immigrants. In particular, by drawing on a parallel US survey, we explore whether Canadians' relatively unique (positive) attitudes toward immigration make them more immune to economic and cultural threat manipulations than their American counterparts. The analysis is based on an experimental design embedded in a series of immigrant vignettes that vary the ethnoracial background and social status of an individual applying for immigration. We examine overall support for immigration, as well as the extent to which both ethnic and economic status cues affect support for individual immigrants. We also explore variance within Canada, specifically, in Quebec versus the rest of the country. Results offer new and unique information on the structure of attitudes on diversity and immigration in Canada. Most importantly, they suggest the relative importance of economic cues in support for immigration in both countries. Divers travaux de recherche ont sugg{\'e}r{\'e} que les attitudes des citoyens au sujet de l'immigration sont influenc{\'e}es par leur perception (a) du statut {\'e}conomique et (b) de l'ethnie des immigrants. Afin de tenter de savoir jusqu'{\`a} quel point les informations socio{\'e}conomiques et culturelles ont effectivement un impact sur le soutien des citoyens envers les immigrants, la pr{\'e}sente {\'e}tude fait usage d'un sondage men{\'e} en ligne avec un {\'e}chantillon repr{\'e}sentatif de la population canadienne.

In particular, we draw on the literature in social psychology to explore the role of locus of control in promoting more ethnocentric and restrictive attitudes towards immigration. We conceptualize control at three levels: (1) perceptions of individual locus of control (i.e., feeling that one can control one's own circumstances), (2) perceptions of societal control (i.e., feeling that one's country has control over immigration), and (3) perceptions of an outgroup's locus of control (i.e., feeling that an outgroup's social circumstances are attributable to dispositional rather than external factors). Results show that all three measures of control are important predictors of negative attitudes toward immigrants: Those who feel in control (personally or as a society) are less hostile towards immigrants, while those who attribute negative outcomes to immigrants' predispositions are also more hostile. Results also suggest that measures of control are related to, but distinct from, both partisanship and racial prejudice.},

Yet suddenly the heads of these and other manufacturing giants found themselves begging governments for financial packages to save their industries.

No one knows the ins and outs of manufacturing like Hargrove, a man who championed the cause of on-the-line workers but who also earned the immense respect of political and business leaders.In Laying It on the Line, Hargrove explains the crisis from his side of the table, what it means for Canada and how the manufacturing sector can again become this country's foremost economic driver. Along the way, he shares the behind-the-door dealings with GM, Ford, Air Canada and others, explaining the controversial agreements he reached over his decades as Canada's chief labour leader.

While there has been no shortage of either political rhetoric or academic theorizing on this subject, empirical studies have been in shorter supply. This volume seeks to fill that gap by asking: Are Canadian provinces engaged in a race to the bottom and, if so, what are the consequences? The contributors apply insights from economics and political science to several policy fields. What emerges is a theoretical and empirical picture of interprovincial competition that shows it to be more complex than the popular image of a race to the bottom and that also contradicts predictions of an inexorable downward spiral. This timely, practical volume will be of interest to public policy practitioners, as well as to students and scholars of economics and political science.},

This article uses the pulp and paper case to examine the dynamics of environmental standard setting within the Canadian federal state. Provincial regulatory incentives are analyzed using two-player games as a heuristic. The article then considers the federal government's role in establishing national standards. Many authors have emphasized the importance of federal involvement to overcome provincial reluctance to regulate unilaterally, lest jobs be lost to jurisdictions with weaker environmental standards. However, few have considered whether the federal government has incentives to do just that. It is argued that those incentives are weak at best, in light of resistance from both the regulated industry and jurisdictionally defensive provinces. In environmental regulation of the Canadian pulp and paper industry, federal reluctance resulted in a two-tier system of environmental standards with strict standards for the largest provinces, and weaker ones for smaller provinces that rely more on the federal government.},

But most existing studies are cross-sectional and can shed little light on the economy-wide forces that shift public opinion on immigration. In this paper I use the six rounds of the European Social Survey (2002-2012) to test the effects of macro-level shocks on immigration opinion for 20 countries. For Europe as a whole the shifts in opinion have been remarkably mild but with differences between countries that reflect the severity of the recession. Pro-immigration opinion is negatively related to the share of immigrants in the population and to the share of social benefits in GDP, but only weakly to unemployment. These effects are common across different socioeconomic groups and there is little evidence of divergence in opinion. The continuing rise in support for right wing populist parties during the recession owes more to growing Euro-scepticism than to a surge in anti-immigrant sentiment.},

Has class become irrelevant as a predictor of social policy preferences? Or do we simply mis-conceptualise today's class conflict over social policy? To what extent has it changed from a divide over the               level               of social policy generosity to a divide over the               kind               of social policy and -- more specifically -- over the               relative importance               that should be given to different social policies? Answering these questions is not only relevant to understand welfare politics in the twenty-first century, but electoral politics as well: only when we understand what working- and middle-class voters care about, can we evaluate the role distributive policies play in electoral processes. We use original survey data from eight West European countries to show that middle- and working-class respondents indeed differ in the relative importance they attribute to social investment and social consumption policies. Middle-class respondents consistently attribute higher absolute and relative importance to social investment. We also show that this emphasis on investive policies relates to the middle class expecting better future economic and social opportunities than the working class. This divide in anticipated opportunities underlies a new kind of working- versus middle-class divide, which contributes to transforming the class divide from a conflict over the level of social policy to a conflict over the priorities of social policy.},

It is based on membership surveys which have been administered, gathered and collated by a group of prominent party scholars from across Europe, Canada and Israel. Utilizing this rich data source together with the insights of party scholars, the book investigates what party membership means in advanced industrial democracies. In doing so, it provides a clearer picture of who joins political parties, why they do it, the character of their political activism, how they engage with their parties, and what opinions they hold."--},

How do we get back to a place where Canada~leads in those areas that Canadians feel passionate about?Author of Dead Centre, Jamey Heath, watched the left fracture before his eyes when he was the NDP's lead strategist from 2003 to 2006.

He then sounds a clarion call to regroup and tackle our nations' challenges.~With~refreshing, contrarian insight~Heath will find a significant audience among Liberals, Greens, New Democrats and the growing number of politically minded -- but party neutral --~progressives that want~sensible leadership and a renaissance of Canadian nationhood.Dead Centre is printed on biodegradeable paper with environmentally friendly inks.},

In order to do so, it first sets aside several of the misconceptions that have arisen about his work. The first concerns its generality. Veblen must be understood not merely as a critic of an obsolete ``aristocratic'' pattern of upper-class consumption, but rather as the progenitor of a general theory of the relationship between class, status, private property, and social inequality. The second major misunderstanding of Veblen's work arises from the assumption that he is engaged in moralizing social criticism. On the contrary, Veblen shared with both Marx and Freud the desire to refrain from making simple value judgments.},

  abstract = {"Uncertainty in Policy Making explores how uncertainty is interpreted and used by policy makers, experts and politicians. It argues that conventional notions of rational, evidence-based policy making - hailed by governments and organisations across the world as the only way to make good policy - is an impossible aim in highly complex and uncertain environments; the blind pursuit of such a 'rational' goal is in fact irrational in a world of competing values and interests. The book centres around two high-profile and important case studies: the Iraq war and climate change policy in the US, UK and Australia. Based on three years' research, including interviews with experts such as Hans Blix, Paul Pillar, and Brian Jones, these two case studies show that thetreatment of uncertainty issues in specialist advice is largely determined by how well the advice fits with or contradicts the policy goals and orientation of the policy elite. Instead of allowing the debates to be side-tracked by arguments over whose science or expert advice is 'more right', we must accept that uncertainty in complex issues is unavoidable and recognise the values and interests that lie at the heart of the issues. The book offers a 'hedging' approach which will enable policy makers to manage rather than eliminate uncertainty."--Publisher's website.},

His account ranges from Michael Jordan's respect for the game of basketball to Greek philosophy, from twenty-first-century corporate and political scandals to Christian theology and the concept of office and professionalism. Think what you will about one institution or another, but after Heclo, no reader will be left in doubt about why it matters to think institutionally.},

Previous failures to show this effect were probably due to the highly thoughtful nature of typical research subjects, when confronted with involving issues. In the present study, field-dependent and field-independent subjects heard convincing or refutable counterattitudinal speeches given by sources of high or low credibility. Results indicated that subjects who are typically low in differentiation of stimuli (field-dependent subjects) showed differential persuasion to strong and weak arguments only when they were presented by a highly credible source. For subjects who are typically high in propensity to differentiate stimuli (field-independent subjects), the arguments were differentially persuasive for both high and low credible sources. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that increasing source credibility can enhance message-relevant thought for subjects who typically do not scrutinize message content.},

  abstract = {L'entente energetique avec les provinces de l'Ouest souligne l'ouverture vers les marches mondiaux des prix et de la production de l'industrie petroliere canadienne. L'entente et les changements subsequents au niveau de la fiscalite et des royautes de chaque palier de gouvernement denotent aussi un important transfert de fonds du gouvernement federal vers les compagnies productrices. L'intention derriere ces deux changements combines, c'etait alors de permettre a l'industrie petroliere d'etre un 'moteur de croissance' pour le reste de l'economie, surtout dans l'Ouest canadien. Dans le present article, nous utilisons le modele MACE pour analyser les effets globaux de ces deux aspects de l'entente avec l'Ouest. Nous analysons aussi les consequences de la baisse radicale des prix mondiaux du petrole au debut de 1986, en examinant les effets macroeconomiques de meme que les effets directs sur les taxes et les royautes sur le petrole, sur les revenus accumules par l'industrie et sur la vitalite de l'industrie petroliere. L'effet de la dereglementation sur les prix, les revenus energetiques et l'activite economique est en somme assez modeste, tandis que les effets fiscaux auront probablement un impact beaucoup plus vaste. Ces changements augmentent legerement l'efficacite de l'extraction, mais reduisent les rendements economiques nets accumules au nom des Canadiens. L'impact macroeconomique direct de changements dans la fiscalite et les royautes sera, en effet, positif; mais on estime que cet impact s'annulera si on doit prelever d'autres taxes pour les fins de l'entente. L'impact des revenus petroliers moins eleves entre 1985 et 1990 a cause de la baisse des prix est absorbe a 40 pour cent par l'industrie, 40 pour cent par les gouvernements des provinces productrices et 20 pour cent par le gouvernement federal. Pourtant, pendant la meme periode, le choc des prix du petrole mene a une economie d'aggregat jouissant d'une croissance plus rapide, d'une inflation et d'un chomage moindres. /// The Western Accord marks the opening up to world markets of the pricing and production of the Canadian petroleum industry. The Accord, and the subsequent tax and royalty changes by both levels of government, also mark a major transfer of revenues from the federal government to the producing firms. The combination of these two changes was intended to make the petroleum industry an 'engine of growth' for the rest of the economy, especially in Western Canada. This paper uses the MACE model to analyze the overall effects of these two aspects of the Western Accord. We also analyse the consequences of the sharp drop of world oil prices in early 1986, examining the macroeconomic effects as well as the direct effects on petroleum taxes and royalties, industry revenues, and the level of activity in the petroleum industry. The net effect of deregulation on prices, energy revenues, and economic activity is fairly modest, while the tax changes are likely to have much larger effects. They slightly increase the efficiency of extraction, but reduce net economic rents accruing to Canadians. The direct macroeconomic impacts of the tax and royalty changes will indeed be positive, but these effects are estimated to be more than offset if other taxes are raised to pay for the Accord. The impact of lower petroleum revenues over the 1985-1990 period due to the low oil prices is absorbed about 40 per cent by industry, 40 per cent by the governments of the producing provinces, and 20 per cent by the federal government. However, during the same period, the oil price shock leads to an aggregate economy that is growing faster with less inflation and less unemployment.},

Constraints are usually conceptualized as the exact opposite to resources and considered to shackle leaders, limit their capacity, and make them less eminent. This article launches two related criticisms of this widely held view: First, many constraints, usually conceptualized as the opposite to resources, tend to be ambiguous in character; some of them may even provide opportunities to demonstrate an actor's particular leadership qualities. Getting hold of this phenomenon is facilitated by reconceptualising constraints as potential `negative resources'. Second, while leaders commanding limited resources and facing major constraints may, after all, be still less predominant than resource-rich `strong leaders', the ongoing transformation of contemporary notions of `good leadership', which values collaboration and exchange over domination and control, looks set to benefit this type of leaders in terms of recognition and perceived performance. Empirically, the focus of this article is on political chief executives, that is, presidents and prime ministers.},

A probit analysis is used to examine what influenced the students' decisions to cooperate or defect in each game. The authors found that American students behaved in a more self-interested, less cooperative manner than the Chinese students did in the prisoner's dilemma experiment. They also found that when foreign students studying in the United States are included with the American students to create a sample of students who grew up in a variety of different market economies, these students also behaved in a less cooperative manner than their Chinese counterparts.},

The article starts from the premise that, in order to fully assess the impact of the contemporary crisis, classic economic voting hypotheses focused on incumbent parties need to be combined with accounts of long-term party system change provided by realignment and dealignment theories. The empirical analysis draws on an original dataset of election results and economic and political indicators in 30 European democracies. The results indicate that during the Great Recession economic strain was associated with sizable losses for incumbent parties and an increasing destabilisation of Western European party systems, while its impact was significantly weaker in Central and Eastern European countries, where political rather than economic failures appeared to be more relevant. In line with the realignment perspective, the results also reveal that in Western Europe populist radical right, radical left and non-mainstream parties benefited the most from the economic hardship, while support for mainstream parties decreased further.},

We investigate whether physicians' own political views affect their treatment decisions on these issues. We linked the records of over 20,000 primary care physicians in 29 US states to a voter registration database, obtaining the physicians' political party affiliations. We then surveyed a sample of Democratic and Republican primary care physicians. Respondents evaluated nine patient vignettes, three of which addressed especially politicized health issues (marijuana, abortion, and firearm storage). Physicians rated the seriousness of the issue presented in each vignette and their likelihood of engaging in specific management options. On the politicized health issues-and only on such issues-Democratic and Republican physicians differed substantially in their expressed concern and their recommended treatment plan. We control for physician demographics (like age, gender, and religiosity), patient population, and geography. Physician partisan bias can lead to unwarranted variation in patient care. Awareness of how a physician's political attitudes might affect patient care is important to physicians and patients alike.},

To probe these implications, we analyze a unique archive of 146 advertising experiments conducted by US campaigns in 2018 and 2020 using the platform Swayable. This archive includes 617 advertisements produced by 51 campaigns and tested with over 500,000 respondents. Importantly, we analyze the complete archive, avoiding publication bias. We find small but meaningful variation in the persuasive effects of advertisements. In addition, we find that common theories about what makes advertising persuasive have limited and context-dependent power to predict persuasiveness. These findings indicate that experiments can compound money's influence in elections: it is difficult to predict ex ante which ads persuade, experiments help campaigns do so, but the gains from these findings principally accrue to campaigns well-financed enough to deploy these ads at scale.},

  publisher = {Routledge},
  abstract = {Buried in many people and operating largely outside the realm of conscious thought are forces inclining us toward liberal or conservative political convictions. Our biology predisposes us to see and understand the world in different ways, not always reason and the careful consideration of facts. These predispositions are in turn responsible for a significant portion of the political and ideological conflict that marks human history. With verve and wit, renowned social scientists John Hibbing, Kevin Smith, and John Alford{\^a}pioneers in the field of biopolitics{\^a}present overwhelming evidence that people differ politically not just because they grew up in different cultures or were presented with different information. Despite the oft-heard longing for consensus, unity, and peace, the universal rift between conservatives and liberals endures because people have diverse psychological, physiological, and genetic traits. These biological differences influence much of what makes people who they are, including their orientations to politics. Political disputes typically spring from the assumption that those who do not agree with us are shallow, misguided, uninformed, and ignorant. Predisposed suggests instead that political opponents simply experience, process, and respond to the world differently. It follows, then, that the key to getting along politically is not the ability of one side to persuade the other side to see the error of its ways but rather the ability of each side to see that the other is different, not just politically, but physically. Predisposed will change the way you think about politics and partisan conflict. As a bonus, the book includes a "Left/Right 20 Questions" game to test whether your predispositions lean liberal or conservative.},

The paper also links the PRFS experience with the public management literature, particularly new public management, and understanding of public sector performance evaluation systems. PRFSs were found to be complex, dynamic systems, balancing peer review and metrics, accommodating differences between fields, and involving lengthy consultation with the academic community and transparency in data and results. Although the importance of PRFSs seems based on their distribution of universities' research funding, this is something of an illusion, and the literature agrees that it is the competition for prestige created by a PRSF that creates powerful incentives within university systems. The literature suggests that under the right circumstances a PRFS will enhance control by professional elites. PRFSs since they aim for excellence, may compromise other important values such as equity or diversity. They will not serve the goal of enhancing the economic relevance of research.},

We explore the social spending consequences of government partisanship, electoral competition and turnout, and the self-interested behaviors of politicians and bureaucrats, as well as such relatively durable facets of political institutions as neocorporatism, state centralization, and traditionalist policy legacies. Pooled time series analyses of welfare effort in 18 nations during the 1960-82 period show that electoral turnout, as well as left and center governments increase welfare effort; that the welfare efforts of governments led by particular types of parties show significant differences and vary notably with the strength of oppositional (and junior coalitional) parties; and that relatively neocorporatist, centralized, and traditionalistic polities are high on welfare effort. Overall, our findings suggest that contrary to many claims, both partisan and nonpartisan facets of democratic politics and political institutions shape contemporary social welfare effort.}

For most laws Parliament has the final word on how social policy is balanced against protected rights. Thus the extent to which legislation is sensitive towards rights depends on how those who develop, propose, and assess policy view the Charter. How influential are governmental legal advisors? How risk averse or risk tolerant are government ministers when pursuing legislative goals that may result in Charter challenges? How capable is Parliament in requiring government to justify and explain legislative choices that may impair rights? In Charter Conflicts Janet Hiebert examines these questions while analyzing the Charter's influence on controversial legislative decisions such as social benefits for lesbians and gay men, the regulation of tobacco advertising, the rules of evidence for sexual assault trials, the use of DNA for law enforcement purposes, and the rules for police searches of private residences. She questions the broadly held assumption that only courts are capable of respecting rights, arguing that Parliament shares responsibility with the judiciary for resolving Charter conflicts. She views the Charter's significance less in terms of the judiciary overruling Parliament than in the incentives and pressures it provides for public and political officials to satisfy themselves that legislation is consistent with protected rights.},

  abstract = {Scholars do not usually test for the duration of the effects of mass communication, but when they do, they typically find rapid decay. Persuasive impact may end almost as soon as communication ends. Why so much decay? Does mass communication produce any long-term effects? How should this decay color our understanding of the effects of mass communication? We examine these questions with data from the effects of advertising in the 2000 presidential election and 2006 subnational elections, but argue that our model and results are broadly applicable within the field of political communication. We find that the bulk of the persuasive impact of advertising decays quickly, but that some effect in the presidential campaign endures for at least 6 weeks. These results, which are similar in rolling cross-section survey data and county-level data on actual presidential vote, appear to reflect a mix of memory-based processing (whose effects last only as long as short-term memory lasts) and online processing (whose effects are more durable). Finally, we find that immediate effects of advertising are larger in subnational than presidential elections, but decay more quickly and more completely.

  abstract = {An innovator in contemporary thought on economic and political development looks here at decline rather than growth. Albert O. Hirschman makes a basic distinction between alternative ways of reacting to deterioration in business firms and, in general, to dissatisfaction with organizations: one, ``exit,'' is for the member to quit the organization or for the customer to switch to the competing product, and the other, ``voice,'' is for members or customers to agitate and exert influence for change ``from within.''The efficiency of the competitive mechanism, with its total reliance on exit, is questioned for certain important situations. As exit often undercuts voice while being unable to counteract decline, loyalty is seen in the function of retarding exit and of permitting voice to play its proper role.The interplay of the three concepts turns out to illuminate a wide range of economic, social, and political phenomena. As the author states in the preface, ``having found my own unifying way of looking at issues as diverse as competition and the two-party system, divorce and the American character, black power and the failure of 'unhappy' top officials to resign over Vietnam, I decided to let myself go a little.''},

However, the problem with their line of argument is that IL and PBL approaches are highly scaffolded. In this article, we first demonstrate that Kirschner et al. have mistakenly conflated PBL and IL with discovery learning. We then present evidence demonstrating that PBL and IL are powerful and effective models of learning. Far from being contrary to many of the principles of guided learning that Kirschner et al. discussed, both PBL and IL employ scaffolding extensively thereby reducing the cognitive load and allowing students to learn in complex domains. Moreover, these approaches to learning address important goals of education that include content knowledge, epistemic practices, and soft skills such as collaboration and self-directed learning.},

  abstract = {"During the time men live without a common Power to keep them all in awe, they are in that condition which is called Warre"Written during the turmoil of the English Civil War,~Leviathan~is an ambitious and highly original work of political philosophy. Claiming that man's essential nature is competitive and selfish, Hobbes formulates the case for a powerful sovereign---or "Leviathan"---to enforce peace and the law, substituting security for the anarchic freedom he believed human beings would otherwise experience. This worldview shocked many of Hobbes's contemporaries, and his work was publicly burnt for sedition and blasphemy when it was first published. But in his rejection of Aristotle's view of man as a naturally social being, and in his painstaking analysis of the ways in which society can and should function, Hobbes opened up a whole new world of political science.Based on the original 1651 text, this edition incorporates Hobbes's own corrections, while also retaining the original spelling and punctuation, to read with vividness and clarity. C. B. Macpherson's introduction elucidates one of the most fascinating works of modern philosophy for the general reader.For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

  abstract = {A democracy falters when most of its citizens are uninformed or misinformed, when misinformation affects political decisions and actions, or when political actors foment misinformation---the state of affairs the United States faces today, as this timely book makes painfully clear. In Do Facts Matter? Jennifer L. Hochschild and Katherine Levine Einstein start with Thomas Jefferson's ideal citizen, who knows and uses correct information to make policy or political choices. What, then, the authors ask, are the consequences if citizens are informed but do not act on their knowledge? More serious, what if they do act, but on incorrect information? Analyzing the use, nonuse, and misuse of facts in various cases---such as the call to impeach Bill Clinton, the response to global warming, Clarence Thomas's appointment to the Supreme Court, the case for invading Iraq, beliefs about Barack Obama's birthplace and religion, and the Affordable Care Act---Hochschild and Einstein argue persuasively that errors of commission (that is, acting on falsehoods) are even more troublesome than errors of omission. While citizens' inability or unwillingness to use the facts they know in their political decision making may be frustrating, their acquisition and use of incorrect ``knowledge'' pose a far greater threat to a democratic political system.Do Facts Matter? looks beyond individual citizens to the role that political elites play in informing, misinforming, and encouraging or discouraging the use of accurate or mistaken information or beliefs. Hochschild and Einstein show that if a well-informed electorate remains a crucial component of a successful democracy, the deliberate concealment of political facts poses its greatest threat.},

On assessment of improvement of OAB symptoms, only 30\% of the traditionally treated patients? parents reported resolution of symptoms at 3 months, whereas 85\% of enema patients did. At the onset of the study, the average pediatric voiding dysfunction score of all patients was 14, whereas on follow-up, the average scores for traditionally treated patients and enema-treated patients were 12 and 4, respectively. This study demonstrated that daily enema therapy is superior to traditional methods for the treatment of OAB.},

  abstract = {There are 2 polar schools of thought regarding the existence of preferences. The economics tradition is based on the assumption of existing preferences. The emerging constructive processing approach assumes preferences are constructed based on the task and context factors present during choice or preference elicitation. Most researchers believe in a middle ground in which consumers construct their preferences when they are new to a category and eventually develop more stable preferences with experience in a domain. This research was designed to bridge the gap between these 2 schools of thought by understanding the process by which preferences are learned and developed over time. Specifically, we investigated the impact of several dimensions of experience (effort, choice, and experience) on preference stability. Results revealed that the type of experience and its corresponding effort had a large impact on the process of preference development. Study 1 demonstrated that by exposing participants to the trade-offs in their environment, their preferences developed and stabilized most rapidly. In addition, the act of making a choice (Study 2) and repeated choices (Study 3) both led to increased preference stability as indicated by measures of objective and subjective preference stability.},

As such political marketing efforts proliferate, the factors that drive electoral success warrant greater attention and investigation. The authors employ a combination of laboratory studies and analysis of actual election results to reveal influences of candidate appearance and spending strategies in campaigns. They analyze how personality trait inferences based on candidate appearance interact with political party brand image, advertising spending, and negative advertising. The results indicate that appearance-based inferences about candidates influence election outcomes, but their impact is driven partially by trait associations at the party brand level. This interaction between appearance and party alters the effects of advertising spending, particularly the effects of negative advertising. The findings have implications for the marketing of political candidates in terms of their party's brand image.},

Holsti explores the poorly understood role of public opinion in international affairs, looking at Americans' capacity to make informed judgments about issues far removed from their personal experience. "Impressively comprehensive and current: an excellent revision of a book by the \#1 authority on the topic. This new edition will remain at the forefront for consultation and textbook adoption on the topic for years to come." -Bruce Russett, Yale University "I thought the first edition was the best single treatment of the subject-so, apparently, did the student who 'borrowed' my copy-and this is a worthy successor. The new edition almost flawlessly accomplishes the goal Holsti sets for himself: an update of his landmark book in light of emerging research and the dramatically changed state of the world that confronts U.S. foreign policy." -Randy Siverson, University of California, Davis "For those who are curious about the impact of 9/11 on American public opinion, for serious students of the relationship between foreign policy and public opinion, for anyone who wants to understand contemporary American opinion about the United States' place in the world, and for citizens tired of conventional wisdom about a difficult and important subject, Holsti's study is not only interesting and topical, it is essential." -Maxine Isaacs, Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University "In an age of almost weekly polling on foreign policy, Holsti's insights are indispensable. He delivers double tour de force in this new edition, providing his own current and historical research along with a comprehensive synthesis of the existing literature. His analysis of the relationships between public opinion and foreign policy since 9/11 will prove particularly valuable for students and scholars alike." -Richard Eichenberg, Tufts University "Holsti combines a vast knowledge of political history and a mastery of the relevant scholarship with up-to-date empirical data to address the question of what role the general public can play in shaping foreign policy.

We found a robust global source credibility effect for scientific authorities, which we dub `the Einstein effect': across all 24 countries and all levels of religiosity, scientists held greater authority than spiritual gurus. In addition, individual religiosity predicted a weaker relative preference for the statement from the scientist compared with the spiritual guru, and was more strongly associated with credibility judgements for the guru than the scientist. Independent data on explicit trust ratings across 143 countries mirrored our experimental findings. These findings suggest that irrespective of one's religious worldview, across cultures science is a powerful and universal heuristic that signals the reliability of information.},

Using an uncompensated, opt-in panel of 11,000 Pennsylvanians (2020-2022), we benchmark self-reports against vote histories, campaign contributions, election returns, and Census data. Ours is among the first such benchmarking exercises in more than a decade, a period when online survey research has transformed. It is also among the first analyzing a longitudinal panel. Our panelists are approximately balanced on partisanship; attrition is limited. Notably, respondents are very politically engaged, with high rates of turnout, campaign contributions, and rally attendance. Ethnic/racial minorities are under-represented. Political attitudes show high over-time stability, and an experiment uncovers few partisan differences in response rates. Such survey samples are cost-effective ways to track the views of highly engaged citizens over time, but lower-engagement citizens prove hard to recruit, even with supplemental efforts. Survey participation is itself a political behavior.},

  abstract = {The vote for Brexit is not an isolated event, but part of a wave of populist, anti-elite revolts: a new `anti-system' politics Western democracies are experiencing, shaking the existing consensus around economic integration, free markets and liberal values. This wave takes a variety of forms, but has in common a robust, even violent, rejection of the mainstream political elites and their values, and a demand for governments to act on the sources of social and economic distress and inequality. This article views Brexit as a part of this new anti-system politics, a reaction to the decline in ideological competition in democracies and the increasing impotence of politicians to address the upheavals wrought by global free market capitalism. This reaction has become particularly acute after the financial crisis of the late 2000s, which affected Britain disproportionately, and the failure of austerity policies to revive growth, crystallising the ineffectiveness of existing policies to deal with economic stagnation and cultural change. This policy failure is compounded by a perceived refusal of politicians to engage with the broader public and a lack of real choice between the mainstream political parties. The article will present evidence that a failed policy consensus, a rise in inequality and a decline in the representativeness of political elites, rather than a resurgence of intolerance or xenophobia, are the principal causes of the Brexit vote.},

Using daily content data from the major news bulletins and daily survey data from the 2007 national election campaign in Denmark (N = 5,083), our analysis improves upon two central aspects of this earlier research. First, the effects on vote choice of the parties' visibility and tone in the media are studied concurrently in the same model. Second, a distinction is made between the effects of direct exposure to specific news content and the effects of the cumulative information environment created by the media. Overall, it is found that the more visible and the more positive the tone toward a given party is, the more voters are inclined to vote for this party. The effects are primarily effects of the information environment, not effects of direct exposure, though undecided voters are also directly affected. In the discussion, central conditions for the strength of media effects are identified.},

Farewell to the Leftist Working Class aims to fill this gap by developing, testing, and confirming an alternative explanation of rightist tendencies among the underprivileged. The authors argue that cultural issues revolving around individual liberty and maintenance of social order have become much more significant since World War II. The obligation to work and strict notions of deservingness have become central to the debate about the welfare state. Indeed, although economic egalitarianism is more typically found among the working class, it is only firmly connected to a universalistic and inclusionary progressive political ideology among the middle class. Farewell to the Leftist Working Class reports cutting-edge research into the withering away of working-class support for the left and the welfare state, drawing mostly on survey data collected in Western Europe, the United States, and other Western countries.},

EE and BPA are reported to impair reproductive organ development in laboratory animals; however, effects of lower doses of these chemicals have been debated. The goal of the current study was to determine whether relatively low oral doses of EE or BPA would alter male reproductive morphology and associated hormone levels of Long Evans hooded rat. Dams were gavaged with corn oil vehicle, EE (0.05-50 mug/kg/day) or BPA (2, 20, and 200 mug/kg/day) during pregnancy through lactation from gestational day 7 to postnatal day (PND) 18. Anogenital distance was measured at PND2 and nipple retention was measured at PND14 in male pups. Male offspring were euthanized beginning at PND150, and sera and organs were collected for analyses. Adult body weight was significantly decreased in males exposed to 50 mug EE/kg/day. Developmental EE exposure reduced androgen-dependent tissue weights in a dose-dependent fashion; for example, seminal vesicle and paired testes weights were reduced with {$>$}/= 5 mug EE/kg/day. Epididymal sperm counts were also significantly decreased with 50 mug EE/kg/day. In contrast, treatment with 2, 20, or 200 mug BPA/kg/day or EE at 0.05-1.5 mug/kg/day did not significantly affect any male endpoint in the current study. These results demonstrate that developmental exposure to oral micromolar doses of EE can permanently disrupt the reproductive tract of the male rat.},

However, given that protest is risky in authoritarian societies and requires collective participation, propaganda can also reduce citizens' inclination to protest by making them think that other citizens, rather than themselves, may have been influenced by propaganda and are, as a result, unwilling to protest. We test this indirect mechanism of propaganda using a survey experiment with Chinese internet users from diverse backgrounds and find that they do believe propaganda affects other citizens' support for and beliefs about the government more than their own support and beliefs. Moreover, they believe that propaganda reduces other citizens' willingness to protest, which in turn reduces their own willingness to protest. Therefore, the power of propaganda may sometimes lie more in the social perceptions and uncertainty it creates than in its direct individual effects.},

Stephens offer the most systematic examination to date of the origins, character, effects, and prospects of generous welfare states in advanced industrial democracies in the post---World War II era. They demonstrate that prolonged government by different parties results in markedly different welfare states, with strong differences in levels of poverty and inequality. Combining quantitative studies with historical qualitative research, the authors look closely at nine countries that achieved high degrees of social protection through different types of welfare regimes: social democratic states, Christian democratic states, and "wage earner" states. In their analysis, the authors emphasize the distribution of influence between political parties and labor movements, and also focus on the underestimated importance of gender as a basis for mobilization.  Building on their previous research, Huber and Stephens show how high wages and generous welfare states are still possible in an age of globalization and trade competition.},

Christian democratic governance is an important determinant of public funding of services, but is not related to public delivery. State structure is also an important determinant. Women's labor force participation is an important determinant of the expansion of public social welfare services net of other social, political, and historical factors. The analysis also shows an interactive effect of women's labor force participation and social democratic governance on public delivery of welfare state services. We conclude that public delivery of a wide range of welfare state services is the most distinctive feature of the social democratic welfare state and that this feature is a product of the direct and interactive effects of social democracy and women's mobilization.},

But their model of group identity fails to shed much light on the origins of political behavior and gives members of the public less credit than they deserve, for three reasons. First, group politics is not a hollow exercise; it depends on the identification of a collective grievance that has a potential political solution. Second, concerns about group economics, status, and respect are more likely than individual economic considerations to animate political behavior, yet the former concerns are no less rational than the latter. Third, individuals vary in how strongly they identify with politically relevant groups, masking considerable variation in the degree to which group affiliations shape political behavior. Therefore, group identification is not a monolithic, irrational force that affects people regardless of their perceptions of political reality.},

A series of experiments underscore the power of partisan identity to generate action-oriented emotions that drive campaign activity. Strongly identified partisans feel angrier than weaker partisans when threatened with electoral loss and more positive when reassured of victory. In contrast, those who hold a strong and ideologically consistent position on issues are no more aroused emotionally than others by party threats or reassurances. In addition, threat and reassurance to the party's status arouse greater anger and enthusiasm among partisans than does a threatened loss or victory on central policy issues.

We examine the First and Second Abortion decisions, which show the difference in approach to constitutional review occurring at the time that legislation is first introduced versus when a law has been in place for some time, as well as a series of decisions challenging various aspects of the Transsexual Law, which deal with evolving social scientific knowledge. We go on to consider whether the Supreme Court of Canada's current approach to social science evidence could be improved upon by engaging with the German comparator in three areas: the process for receiving and evaluating social science evidence; dealing with changes in the state of the science or the emergence of new bodies of scientific knowledge; and the role of deference as it relates to social science evidence. We conclude that some guidance on these issues might be found in the German jurisprudence.},

In all cases the data at hand are likely to be afflicted by selection bias. Failing to take into consideration this problem leads to serious biases in the estimation of simple relationships. Empirical examples illustrate a possible solution (a variation of a Tobit model) to the problems in these cases.

An empirical example studying the impact of rules regulating the access to ballots in national elections in 21 western democracies illustrates this problem. Taking into account the formation process when studying the success of new parties, however, allows for a correction. Similar solutions exist for other research designs employed to study the success of new parties.},

The volume focuses on the work of key social theorists, including J{\"u}rgen Habermas, Niklas Luhmann, Michel Foucault, Ulrich Beck, Pierre Bourdieu, Anthony Giddens, Robert Putnam, Erving Goffman, Peter L. Berger, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, Bruno Latour, Leon Mayhew, Dorothy Smith and Max Weber. Unique in its approach, the collection demonstrates how the theories of these scholars come to bear on the understanding of public relations as a social activity. Understanding public relations in its societal context entails a focus on such concepts as trust, legitimacy, understanding, and reflection, as well as on issues of power, behavior, and language.Each chapter is devoted to an individual theorist, providing an overview of that theorist's key concepts and contributions, and exploring how these concepts can be applied to public relations as a practice. Each chapter also includes a box giving a short and concise presentation of the theorist, along with recommendation of key works and secondary literature.Overall, this volume will enhance understanding of theories and their applications in public relations, expanding the breadth and depth of the theoretic foundations of public relations. It will be of great interest to scholars and graduate students in public relations and strategic communication.},

  abstract = {Using a new measure of urbanity for every federal electoral district in Canada from 1896 to the present, this article describes the long-term development of the urban-rural divide in Canadian federal elections. We focus on three questions: (1) when the urban-rural divide has existed in Canada, identifying three main periods---the 1920s, the 1960s and 1993--present---in which the urban-rural cleavage has been especially important in federal elections; (2) where the urban-rural divide has existed, finding that in the postwar period the urban-rural cleavage is a pan-Canadian phenomenon; and (3) how well urbanity predicts district-level election outcomes. We argue that the urban-rural divide is important for understanding election outcomes during several periods of Canadian political development, and never more so than in recent decades. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for research on urban-rural cleavages, Canadian electoral politics and Canadian political development. , R{\'e}sum{\'e} {\`A} l'aide d'une nouvelle mesure de l'urbanit{\'e} pour chaque circonscription {\'e}lectorale f{\'e}d{\'e}rale au Canada de 1896 {\`a} aujourd'hui, cet article d{\'e}crit l'{\'e}volution {\`a} long terme de l'urbain-rural dans la politique {\'e}lectorale f{\'e}d{\'e}rale canadienne.

However, the effect of differing source credibility on bullshit profoundness evaluations has, to our knowledge, not yet been tested. We presented participants with pseudo-profound bullshit alone and with authors of different credibility. In order to partly replicate and extend on the findings regarding mechanisms of receptivity and sensitivity to bullshit we collected profoundness evaluations for mundane statements and proverbs, and different measures of analytic thinking. Ascribing credible authors leads to an increase while ascribing uncredible authors leads to a decrease in profoundness evaluations. Cognitive reflection protects against the tendency to evaluate any type of statement as profound and drives better differentiation between pseudo- and conventionally truly profound, while positive views about actively open-minded thinking enable stronger effects of uncredible authorship.},

  abstract = {The two-way linear fixed effects regression ( FE) has become a default method for estimating causal effects from panel data. Many applied researchers use the FE estimator to adjust for unobserved unit-specific and time-specific confounders at the same time. Unfortunately, we demonstrate that the ability of the FE model to simultaneously adjust for these two types of unobserved confounders critically relies upon the assumption of linear additive effects. Another common justification for the use of the FE estimator is based on its equivalence to the difference-in-differences estimator under the simplest setting with two groups and two time periods. We show that this equivalence does not hold under more general settings commonly encountered in applied research. Instead, we prove that the multi-period difference-in-differences estimator is equivalent to the weighted FE estimator with some observations having negative weights. These analytical results imply that in contrast to the popular belief, the FE estimator does not represent a designbased, nonparametric estimation strategy for causal inference. Instead, its validity fundamentally rests on the modeling assumptions.},

Perhaps the most widely-held view of mass support for populism -- the economic insecurity perspective--emphasizes the consequences of profound changes transforming the workforce and society in post-industrial economies. Alternatively, the cultural backlash thesis suggests that support can be explained as a retro reaction by once-predominant sectors of the population to progressive value change. To consider these arguments, Part I develops the conceptual and theoretical framework. Part II of the study uses the 2014 Chapel Hill Expert Survey (CHES) to identify the ideological location of 268 political parties in 31 European countries. Part III compares the pattern of European party competition at national-level. Part IV uses the pooled European Social Survey 1-6 (2002-2014) to examine the cross-national evidence at individual level for the impact of the economic insecurity and cultural values as predictors of voting for populist parties. Part V summarizes the key findings and considers their implications. Overall, we find the most consistent evidence supporting the cultural backlash thesis.},

  abstract = {Summary There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

Although there is a general trend for class voting to decline over time, partially accounted for by the impact of education, we find that most variation in class voting does not take the form of a linear decline. The ideological positions of left-wing parties alone do not have any effect, but the polarization of parties along the left--right dimension is associated with substantially higher levels of class voting.},

Whiteness was once thought to be invisible because of whites' dominant position and ability to claim the mainstream, but today a large portion of whites actively identify with their racial group and support policies and candidates that they view as protecting whites' power and status. In White Identity Politics, Ashley Jardina offers a landmark analysis of emerging patterns of white identity and collective political behavior, drawing on sweeping data. Where past research on whites' racial attitudes emphasized out-group hostility, Jardina brings into focus the significance of in-group identity and favoritism. White Identity Politics shows that disaffected whites are not just found among the working class; they make up a broad proportion of the American public - with profound implications for political behavior and the future of racial conflict in America.},

  abstract = {There exists a long-standing debate about the influence of ideology in economics. Surprisingly, however, there is no concrete empirical evidence to examine this critical issue. Using an online randomized controlled experiment involving 2425 economists in 19 countries, we examine the effect of ideological bias on views among economists. Participants were asked to evaluate statements from prominent economists on different topics, while source attribution for each statement was randomized without participants' knowledge. For each statement, participants either received a mainstream source, an ideologically different less-/non-mainstream source, or no source. We find that changing source attributions from mainstream to less-/non-mainstream, or removing them, significantly reduces economists' reported agreement with statements. This contradicts the image economists have of themselves, with 82\% of participants reporting that in evaluating a statement one should only pay attention to its content. Using a framework of Bayesian updating we examine two competing hypotheses as potential explanations for these results: unbiased Bayesian updating versus ideologically-/authority-biased Bayesian updating. While we find no evidence in support of unbiased updating, our results are consistent with biased Bayesian updating. More specifically, we find that changing/removing sources (1) has no impact on economists' reported confidence with their evaluations; (2) similarly affects experts/non-experts in relevant areas; and (3) has substantially different impacts on economists with different political orientations. Finally, we find significant heterogeneity in our results by gender, country, PhD completion country, research area, and undergraduate major, with patterns consistent with the existence of ideological bias.},

This paper re-evaluates its explanatory power by investigating the relationship between labor market retirement and attitudes towards immigration in 14 European countries. The empirical results, based on an instrumental variable strategy to deal with potential endogeneity, find that although retirement is an important change in a person?s labor market participation, it does not generally shift opinions. As a plausible explanation for this, I use a cross-national survey experiment to demonstrate that individuals who are retired retain socio-tropic orientations towards immigration, which, I argue, likely override their ego-tropic orientations. The combined evidence indicates that the labor market competition hypothesis may not be suitable as a comprehensive explanation for public opinion about immigration.},

  abstract = {In spatial theory a central concept is salience, or the relative importance of issues in a voter's mind in evaluating candidates' platforms. Traditional, self-reported measures of salience have either been national in breadth (``which issues are most important to the nation as a whole?'') or personal (``which issues do you care most about personally?''). In the former case, the subjects are being asked to guess what issues other voters think are important; in the latter case, subjects are likely to report issues that are ``socially'' important to avoid seeming selfish or superficial. Unsurprisingly, such self-reported measures have not been found to explain actual candidate choices by individual voters very well. We introduce a simple process-tracing measure of salience, using mouse-tracking. Experimental participants were asked to rate three hypothetical candidates, using information accessed in a setting where the distribution of attention represents salience in the decision process. Four models were tested: standard city block distance and then the addition of each of the two measures of traditional salience---national and personal---and, finally, the attention distribution measure. Attention distribution improves model fit over the standard distance model and improves~classification~compared to the traditional salience measures.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bisphenol A (BPA) is widely used in the manufacture of polycarbonate plastics, including infant formula bottles. OBJECTIVES: Based on the reported endocrine disruptor activity of this polyphenol, we hypothesized that exposure to BPA early in life would elicit developmental changes in the mammary tissue and cause a predisposition for mammary cancer. METHODS: We exposed neonatal/prepubertal rats to BPA via lactation from nursing dams treated orally with 0, 25, and 250 mug BPA/kg body weight/day. For tumorigenesis studies, female offspring were exposed to 30 mg dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA)/kg body weight at 50 days of age. RESULTS: The combination of DMBA treatment with lactational exposure to BPA demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in mammary tumor multiplicity and reduced tumor latency compared with controls. In the absence of DMBA treatment, lactational BPA exposure resulted in increased cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis at 50 but not 21 days postpartum (shortly after last BPA treatment). Using Western blot analysis, we determined that steroid receptor coactivators (SRCs) 1-3, Akt, phosphorylated Akt, progesterone receptor A (PR-A), and erbB3 proteins were significantly up-regulated at 50 days of age. CONCLUSIONS: The data presented here provide the first evidence that maternal exposure to BPA during lactation increases mammary carcinogenesis in a DMBA-induced model of rodent mammary cancer. Changes in PR-A, SRC 1-3, erbB3, and Akt activity are consistent with increased cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis playing a role in mammary cancer susceptibility. These alterations provide an explanation of enhanced mammary carcinogenesis after lactational BPA exposure.},

It provides an account of the political conflicts of the 1930s and 1940s which gave rise to a model of development in Canada which can be labelled "permeable fordism." Rapid economic growth after the Second World War had specific national traits but these were based on wage relations and macro-economic policies similar to other countries which have been labelled fordist. The political compromise of Canada's "fordism" was, in contrast, quite different. The compromise was based on a new national discourse more than on one stressing the capital-labour relationship and organized by class-based parties. The article demonstrates how these differences were rooted in the political conflict of the 1930s and 1940s, the moment when the earlier model of development came apart around the challenges posed to Canadian federalism by the Depression and the Second World War. /// Cet article fait part de l'approche de la r{\'e}gulation-une des analyses qui contribuent {\`a} red{\'e}finir l'{\'e}tude th{\'e}orique de l'apr{\`e}s-guerre-pour repenser les origines et la fin des {$<<$} crises {$>>$}.

He may be the only psychiatrist who has specialized in the self-esteem problems of both Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein."---The New Yorker "Policy specialists and academic scholars have long agreed that for U.S. leaders to deal effectively with other actors in the international arena, they need images of their adversaries. Leaders must try to see events, and, indeed, their own behavior, from the perspective of opponents. . . . Faulty images are a source of misperceptions and miscalculations that have often led to major errors in policy, avoidable catastrophes, and missed opportunities. History supplies all too many examples."---from the ForewordWhat impels leaders to lead and followers to follow? How did Osama bin Laden, the son of a multibillionaire construction magnate in Saudi Arabia, become the world's number-one terrorist? What are the psychological foundations of man's inhumanity to man, ethnic cleansing, and genocide? Jerrold M. Post contends that such questions can be answered only through an understanding of the psychological foundations of leader personality and political behavior.Post was founding director of the Center for the Analysis of Personality and Political Behavior for the CIA. He developed the political personality profiles of Menachem Begin and Anwar Sadat for President Jimmy Carter's use at the Camp David talks and initiated the U.S. government's research program on the psychology of political terrorism. He was awarded the Intelligence Medal of Merit in 1979 for his leadership of the center.In this book, he draws on psychological and personality theories, as well as interviews with individual terrorists and those who have interacted with particular leaders, to discuss a range of issues: the effects of illness and age on a leader's political behavior; narcissism and the relationship between followers and a charismatic leader; the impact of crisis-induced stress on policymakers; the mind of the terrorist, with a consideration of "killing in the name of God"; and the need for enemies and the rise of ethnic conflict and terrorism in the post-Cold War environment. The leaders he discusses include Fidel Castro, Osama bin Laden, Saddam Hussein, Kim Jong Il, and Slobodan Milosevic.},

Accompanied by a major six-part television series on PBS, How We Got to Now is the story of collaborative networks building the modern world, written in the provocative, informative, and engaging style that has earned Johnson fans around the globe.},

Approval of each majority government in the 1974--1993 period underwent a cycle of honeymoon, decay and recovery. Underneath the cycle was a long-term downward trend. A simple politicoeconomic model accounts for a large fraction of long-term decay and helps explain the anti-government landslides of 1984 and 1993. But the model leaves inter-election popularity cycles largely unexplained. After 1993, the economy ceased to account for popularity and a wholly new, but apparently stable, electoral cycle emerged. The article concludes with speculation on causes of and contingency in electoral cycles., En se fondant sur les r{\'e}sultats des sondages Gallup mensuels, cet article analyse l'{\'e}volution de la popu{\`i}arit{\'e} des gouvemements canadiens entre 1974 et 1998.

It has too many parties, it is susceptible to staggering swings from election to election, and its provincial and federal branches often seem unrelated. Unruly and inscrutable, it is a system that defies logic and classification -- until now. In this political science tour de force, Richard Johnston makes sense of the Canadian party system. With a keen eye for history and deft use of recently developed analytic tools, he articulates a series of propositions underpinning the system. Chief among them was domination by the centrist Liberals, stemming from their grip on Quebec, which blocked both the Conservatives and the NDP. He also takes a close look at other peculiarities of the Canadian party system, including the stunning discontinuity between federal and provincial arenas. For its combination of historical breadth and data-intensive rigour, The Canadian Party System is a rare achievement. Its findings shed light on the main puzzles of the Canadian case, while contesting the received wisdom of the comparative study of parties, elections, and electoral systems elsewhere.},

Comprising a broad exploration of campaign factors (debates, news coverage, advertising, and polls) and their effects (priming, learning, and persuasion), as well as an impressive survey of techniques for the collection and analysis of campaign data, Capturing Campaign Effects examines different kinds of campaigns in the U.S. and abroad and presents strong evidence for significant campaign effects. "Capturing Campaign Effects is an accessible and penetrating account of modern scholarship on electoral politics. It draws critical insights from a range of innovative analyses." --Arthur Lupia, University of Michigan "What a wonderful way to usher in the new era of election studies! This book spotlights fascinating paradoxes in the literature of voting behavior, highlights many promising approaches to resolving those paradoxes, and shows how these strategies can yield important findings with terrific payoffs for our understanding of contemporary democracy. Fasten your seatbelts, folks: scholarship on elections is about to speed up thanks to this collection of great essays." --Jon Krosnick, Stanford University "The past decade has seen a renewed interest in understanding campaign effects. How and when do voters learn? Does the election campaign even matter at all? Capturing Campaign Effects draws on leading political scientists to address these matters. The result is a collection that will become the major reference for the study of campaigns. The lesson that emerges is that campaigns do affect voter decision making, usually for the better." --Robert S. Erikson, Columbia University Henry E.

The paper explores the relation between social class and political ideology using data from a simple survey of approximately 1800 Canadians with jobs. Using Marxist class categories, following theoretical developments by Carchedi, moderate class differences are found to support the labour movement, social welfare expenditures, and redistribution of income. A regression analysis shows that the more left-wing position of the working class reflects a number of aspects of working conditions. Indeed, aspects of the work situation have a considerable impact on political attitudes beyond those differences associated},

As advertising agencies adopted new media buying practices, however, they claimed to use only papers with high circulation. This research tests their claims empirically to see where five politically partisan agencies placed their ads in 1920.},

Canadians exhibited party commitments remarkably like those we have come to expect for U. S. respondents. These commitments shaped respondents' reaction to the events of the campaign: Issue positions lined up with party identification, as did perceptions of the one leader rehabilitated by the campaign. But the campaign also cut through party groups. Such a mixture of reinforcement and displacement might well typify campaigns in Canada and elsewhere. The paper concludes by arguing that academic observers in the United States should take campaigns more seriously than they have to date and that they should consider adopting some of the measurement and analysis strategies of the 1988 Canadian study.},

Early studies in the United States answered these questions in the affirmative. The track record for other systems is spotty, and each question occasioned repeated controversy in the decades since the 1960s. Much of the apparent lability and cross-national variation in party ties can be laid at the feet of measurement error, but not all.

Analysis of the data over the 18 years, however, failed to lend any clear support for either of the hypotheses. In marked contrast, results indicate that the social bases of environmental concern-at least as measured by the NORC environmental spending item-have remained remarkably stable over nearly two decades despite fluctuating economic, political, and environmental conditions. Younger adults, the well-educated, political liberals, Democrats, those raised and currently living in urban areas, and those employed outside of primary industries were found to be consistently more supportive of environmental protection than were their respective counterparts.},

Participants were also asked whether they thought the person described would be discriminated against by others.Results: Both the public and professionals rated outcomes as poorer and discrimination as more likely for the person with schizophrenia than for the one with depression. The professionals made more negative ratings than the public, although the clinical psychologis...},

This paper describes a study of three of them: the predominance of heuristic-driven information processing by members of the public; ideologically motivated reasoning; and the cognitive-style correlates of political conservativism. The study generated both observational and experimental data inconsistent with the hypothesis that political conservatism is distinctively associated with either unreflective thinking or motivated reasoning. Conservatives did no better or worse than liberals on the Cognitive Reflection Test (Frederick, 2005), an objective measure of information-processing dispositions associated with cognitive biases. In addition, the study found that ideologically motivated reasoning is not a consequence of over-reliance on heuristic or intuitive forms of reasoning generally. On the contrary, subjects who scored highest in cognitive reflection were the most likely to display ideologically motivated cognition. These findings corroborated an alternative hypothesis, which identifies ideologically motivated cognition as a form of information processing that promotes individuals' interests in forming and maintaining beliefs that signify their loyalty to important affinity groups. The paper discusses the practical significance of these findings, including the need to develop science communication strategies that shield policy-relevant facts from the influences that turn them into divisive symbols of political identity.},

The psychophysics of value induce risk aversion in the domain of gains and risk seeking in the domain of losses. The psychophysics of chance induce overweighting of sure things and of improbable events, relative to events of moderate probability. Decision problems can be described or framed in multiple ways that give rise to different preferences, contrary to the invariance criterion of rational choice. The process of mental accounting, in which people organize the outcomes of transactions, explains some anomalies of consumer behavior. In particular, the acceptability of an option can depend on whether a negative outcome is evaluated as a cost or as an uncompensated loss. The relationships between decision values and experience values and between hedonic experience and objective states are discussed.

Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman's seminal studies in behavioral psychology, behavioral economics, and happiness studies have influenced numerous other authors, including Steven Pinker and Malcolm Gladwell. In Thinking, Fast and Slow, Kahneman at last offers his own, first book for the general public. It is a lucid and enlightening summary of his life's work. It will change the way you think about thinking.Two systems drive the way we think and make choices, Kahneman explains: System One is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System Two is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. Examining how both systems function within the mind, Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities as well as the biases of fast thinking and the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and our choices. Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, he shows where we can trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking, contrasting the two-system view of the mind with the standard model of the rational economic agent.Kahneman's singularly influential work has transformed cognitive psychology and launched the new fields of behavioral economics and happiness studies. In this path-breaking book, Kahneman shows how the mind works, and offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and personal lives--and how we can guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble.},

We argue that the best estimate of the effects of campaign contact and advertising on Americans' candidates choices in general elections is zero. First, a systematic meta-analysis of 40 field experiments estimates an average effect of zero in general elections. Second, we present nine original field experiments that increase the statistical evidence in the literature about the persuasive effects of personal contact 10-fold. These experiments' average effect is also zero. In both existing and our original experiments, persuasive effects only appear to emerge in two rare circumstances. First, when candidates take unusually unpopular positions and campaigns invest unusually heavily in identifying persuadable voters. Second, when campaigns contact voters long before election day and measure effects immediately --- although this early persuasion decays. These findings contribute to ongoing debates about how political elites influence citizens' judgments.},

However, more than 40 countries in the world employ a two-stage process, where actual voting data are available between the first and the second rounds to help politicians understand their position in relation to each other and to voter preferences and to help them predict the final outcome of the election. In this study we take advantage of the theoretical foundation on voter behavior from the political science literature and the recent methodological advances in choice modeling to develop a Nested Logit Factor Model of voter choice which we use to predict the final outcome of two stage elections and gain insights about the underlying political landscape. We apply the proposed model to data from the first stage and predict the final outcome of two stage elections based on the inferences made from the first stage results. We demonstrate how our proposed model can help politicians understand their competitive position immediately after the first round of actual voting and test its predictive accuracy in the run-off election across 11 different state governorship elections.

Ezlopitant, its two pharmacologically active metabolites, an alkene analogue (CJ-12 458) and a benzyl alcohol analogue (CJ-12 764), and their corresponding trideuterated internal standards (I.S.), were extracted from plasma with methyl tert.-butyl ether (MTBE). The dried MTBE extracts were reconstituted and analyzed using a narrow-bore (2.1 mm I.D.) YMC basic HPLC column and a mobile phase of acetonitrile-20 mM ammonium acetate, pH 5 (60:40, v/v). Column effluent was monitored by pneumatically assisted electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) using the parent to product ions was used to quantify ezlopitant and its two active metabolites. The assay exhibited a linear dynamic range of 0.1-100 ng/ml. Average absolute recoveries from plasma were approximately 71, 80 and 99\% for ezlopitant and its two active metabolites CT-12 485 and CJ-12 764, respectively. The precision (RSD \%) and accuracy (Deviation \%) values for the method were within +/-12\% and +/-15\%, respectively, for all analytes. Sample analysis times were less than 5 min from one injection to the next. The assay proved to be suitable for pharmacokinetics studies. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {In typical survey experiments--i.e., experiments that involve a relatively limited amount of manipulated content--respondent inattentiveness tends to biase treatment effect estimates toward zero. Such bias may be even more pronounced in conjoint experiments, which require respondents to attend to an even larger amount of manipulated content. And yet, little research has investigated strategies of accounting for inattentiveness in conjoint experiments specifically. In this study, we explore potential ways to both measure--and account for--respondent inattentiveness when estimating causal effects in both single- and two-profile conjoint experiments. Replicating published conjoint experiments with large national samples, we demonstrate how researchers can implement a simple strategy using pre-treatment measures of attentiveness. Toward this end, we propose a novel method-- ``conjoint attention checks'' (CACs)--to both measure respondents' attentiveness to conjoint profiles and to provide for more robust tests of hypotheses in conjoint experiments.},

While it is puzzling that the G77 has managed to maintain itself as a group in spite of internal differences along variables as prosperity, emissions and vulnerability to climate change, we claim that a core element behind this cohesion is that these countries share domestic governance problems as much as poverty and economic underdevelopment. Second, we discuss how recent trends of economic and political development in the third world influence the climate policy strategies of the G77 group in the future. The main factor here is the economicand social progress in states like China, India and Brazil, which separates them from the poorer and less powerful G77 states. Increasing heterogeneity along variables like governance, growth, and importance for the international economy is creating an increasing drive among the most successful G77 states towards bilateral agreements with industrialised powers. We do not foresee a departure from traditional G77 positions and membership by these states in the official climate negotiations or a departure from the Kyoto process, but an increasing reliance on bilateral agreements with industrialized countries that link considerations for energy security and the environment. The ability to gain these advantages without commitments may make these states less interested in adopting commitments for the post-Kyoto period. This is unfortunate for the LDCs and the AOSIS groups within the G77, who probably are most vulnerable to climate change.},

Precursors of the cartel party phenomenon can be traced to the 1950s or before, but in recent years it has become increasingly typical rather than aberrational. While there are no fully fledged cartel parties (as there never were fully fledged mass or catch-all parties), the type has developed sufficiently as to justify the specification of an additional `corner' in space, relative to which real-world cases can be anchored.},

In this study we evaluated the effect of fetal exposure to bisphenol A, which mimics estrogenic activity, on aggressive behavior and hormonal change in male mice. On gestation days 11-17, female mice were fed bisphenol A at 2 ng/g or 20 ng/g of body weight (environmentally relevant concentration). Aggression rating and blood sampling of the offspring were done at 8, 12, and 16 weeks of age. Aggression scores increased significantly (p {$<$} 0.01) at 8 weeks of age in male mice exposed to bisphenol A at both the 2 ng/g and 20 ng/g concentrations compared with a control group, but no difference was found after 12 weeks. Relative testis weight (per gram of body weight) was significantly lower at 8 and 12 weeks in mice treated with 2 ng/g than in controls (p {$<$} 0.05) and was significantly lower at 12 weeks in mice treated with 20 ng/g than in controls (p {$<$} 0.01). The serum testosterone concentration in treated mice was not significantly different from that in controls. These results demonstrate that bisphenol A temporarily activated aggressive behavior in mice at 8 weeks of age and that low doses of bisphenol A interfered with the normal development of reproductive organs. The mechanism activating this aggressive behavior was not elevated testosterone concentration.},

John Kekes argues that the present moral and political uncertainties are due to a deep change in our society from a dogmatic to a pluralistic view of values. Dogmatism is committed to there being only one justifiable system of values. Pluralism recognizes many such systems, and yet it avoids a chaotic relativism according to which all values are in the end arbitrary. Maintaining that good lives must be reasonable, but denying that they must conform to one true pattern, Kekes develops and justifies a pluralistic account of good lives and values, and works out its political, moral, and personal implications.},

  pages = {74},
  abstract = {This article presents a statistical analysis of the first 352 Charter of Rights and Freedoms decisions by the Supreme Court of Canada between 1982 and 1997. The author argues that the emerging approach to Charter review by the Supreme Court of Canada has led to a rebalancing of liberal constitutionalism and to a reconciliation between Charter rights and federalism. This stands in stark contrast to the highly activist approach to Charter review detected in studies by Morton, Russell, and Withey and, to a lesser extent, by Morton, Russell, and Riddell. Several factors illustrate the rebalancing of liberal constitutionalism in Canada. First, the Court's support for the rights claimant has stabilized at 34 per cent. Second, Charter review now focuses on the conduct of public officials; statutes and regulations constitute a declining portion of Charter challenges. This has important implications for the relationship between Charter review and federalism, as the centralization thesis lacks a consistent empirical basis to be a true characterization of the Charters effect on provincial autonomy. Finally, the Court during Lamer C.J.C.'s tenure emerged as a centrist Court, as most judges fall within a narrow range of the Court's support rate for the rights claimant in both criminal and noncriminal cases.},

Some critics, suspicious of what they perceive as the "activism" of "unelected and unaccountable" judges, view the increased power of the Supreme Court as a direct challenge to parliament. But has parliamentary democracy been weakened by judicial responses to the Charter? In Governing with the Charter, James Kelly clearly demonstrates that our current democratic deficit is not the result of the Supreme Court's judicial activism. On the contrary, an activist framers' intent surrounds the Charter, and the Supreme Court has simply, and appropriately, responded to this new constitutional environment. While the Supreme Court is admittedly a political actor, it is not the sole interpreter of the Charter, as the court, the cabinet, and bureaucracy all respond to the document, which has ensured the proper functioning of constitutional supremacy in Canada. Kelly analyzes the parliamentary hearings on the Charter and also draws from interviews with public servants, senators, and members of parliament actively involved in appraising legislation to ensure that it is consistent with the Charter. He concludes that the principal institutional outcome of the Charter has been a marginalization of Parliament and that this is due to the Prime Minister's decision on how to govern with the Charter. A significant contribution to law and society studies, Governing with the Charter will be widely read by political scientists, legal scholars, parliamentarians, public servants, and students of the machinery of government.},

  abstract = {This article considers the relationship between rights and federalism in the Supreme Court of Canada's review of cases invoking the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It considers whether the Supreme Court of Canada has compromised provincial autonomy by establishing Canada-wide standards in provincial areas of jurisdiction. It suggests that the centralization thesis associated with judicial review on Charter grounds is inconclusive, and combining several processes under the rubric of centralization, it misrepresents the Charter's effect on Canadian federalism and provincial autonomy. Further, the centralization thesis has lost much momentum during the course of Charter review, and, as a result, is a limited approach to understanding the relationship between rights and federalism in Canada. Specifically, the Supreme Court of Canada has demonstrated sensitivity to federalism in its Charter jurisprudence, most evident in a complex jurisprudence that has served to offset the centralization thesis and its implications for provincial autonomy. This threepart federalism jurisprudence is federalism as gatekeeper, an explicit federalism jurisprudence and an implicit federalism jurisprudence, which is most evident in the relationship between criminal rights and provincial responsibility for the administration of justice. This article demonstrates that the Court's approach to Charter review has seen a reconciliation between rights and federalism, most evident in the declining importance of the centralization thesis and the growing importance of the three-part federalism jurisprudence during Charter review. This sensitivity to federalism has existed since the beginning of the Court's Charter jurisprudence but has largely been overshadowed by the dominance of the centralization thesis in the Charter debate.},

Subjects-Particles reporting on passive smoking research published in newspapers (n = 180) or magazines (n = 92) between January 1981 and December 1994. Main outcome measures-Numbers of articles, conclusions of articles, sources quoted, numbers and characteristics of research studies cited, presence of tobacco advertising. Results-The number of newspaper and magazine articles reporting on passive smoking research increased from four in 1981 to 57 in 1992 and 32 in 1994. Sixty-two per cent (168/272) of articles concluded that the research on passive smoking is controversial. Tobacco industry representatives were quoted significantly more often in newspaper articles (52\%, 94/180) than magazine articles (12\%, 11/92) (p{$<$}0.0001). Of 121 different research studies cited in the Pay press articles, only 15 were from tobacco-industry sponsored projects or publications. In magazines, acceptance of tobacco industry advertising was associated with the conclusion that research on passive smoking is controversial (p{$<$}0.0001). Conclusions-Although research on the harmful effects of passive smoking accumulated between 1981 and 1994, lay press coverage of the research maintained that the science was controversial. Few research studies were cited to support the industry's claim that passive smoking is not harmful to health. However, tobacco industry representatives who were critical of the research methods used to study the health effects of passive smoking were frequently quoted.},

  abstract = {First published in December 1919, this global bestseller attacking those who had made the peace in Paris after the First World War, sparked immediate controversy. It also made John Maynard Keynes famous overnight and soon came to define how people around the world viewed the Versailles Peace Treaty. In Germany the book, which argued against reparations, was greeted with enthusiasm; in France with dismay; and in the US as ammunition that could be (and was) used against Woodrow Wilson in his ultimately unsuccessful bid to sell the League of Nations to an increasingly sceptical American public. Meanwhile in his own country the book provoked outrage amongst establishment critics -- Keynes was even refused membership of the prestigious British Academy -- while admirers from Winston Churchill to the founders of the LSE, Sidney and Beatrice Webb, went on to praise Keynes for his wisdom and humanity. Keynes may have written what he thought was a reasoned critique of the economics of the peace settlement. In effect, he had penned a political bombshell whose key arguments are still being debated today. The Economic Consequences of the Peace is now reissued by Keynes' publisher of choice with a new introduction from Michael Cox, one of the major figures in the field of International Relations today. Scholarly yet engaged and readable, Cox's introduction to the work -- written a century after the book first hit the headlines -- critically appraises Keynes' polemic contextualising and bringing to life the text for a new generation of scholars and students of IR, IPE, Politics and History. The original text and this authoritative introduction provide essential reading for anyone who wishes to understand the tragedy that was the twentieth century; why making peace with former enemies can be just as hard as winning a war against them; and how and why ideas really do matter.},

Keynes's work has undergone significant revaluation in recent years, and "Keynesian" views which have been widely defended for so long are now perceived as at odds with Keynes's own thinking. Recent scholarship and research has demonstrated considerable rivalry and controversy concerning the proper interpretation of Keynes's works, such that recourse to the original text is all the more important. Although considered by a few critics that the sentence structures of the book are quite incomprehensible and almost unbearable to read, the book is an essential reading for all those who desire a basic education in economics. The key to understanding Keynes is the notion that at particular times in the business cycle, an economy can become over-productive (or under-consumptive) and thus, a vicious spiral is begun that results in massive layoffs and cuts in production as businesses attempt to equilibrate aggregate supply and demand. Thus, full employment is only one of many or multiple macro equilibria. If an economy reaches an underemployment equilibrium, something is necessary to boost or stimulate demand to produce full employment. This something could be business investment but because of the logic and individualist nature of investment decisions, it is unlikely to rapidly restore full employment. Keynes logically seizes upon the public budget and government expenditures as the quickest way to restore full employment. Borrowing the * to finance the deficit from private households and businesses is a quick, direct way to restore full employment while at the same time, redirecting or siphoning},

By examining specific verbal components of the debates, however, this study revealed that the nature of presidential debates might actually overpower cultural norms, which are likely to be embedded in debates. These findings imply that by imitating campaign practice developments in the US, many countries are transitioning to media-centered democracies in which various forms of mass media, particularly television, technological innovations, and political marketing approaches, have grown to play a significant role in influencing and changing the nature of electoral communication and other political practices around the globe.},

  abstract = {My purpose is to offer an assessment of the scientific legacy of Converse's "Belief Systems" by reviewing five productive lines of research stimulated by his authoritative analysis and unsettling conclusions. First I recount the later life history of Converse's notion of "nonattitudes," and suggest that as important as nonattitudes are, we should be paying at least as much attention to their opposite: attitudes held with conviction. Second, I argue that the problem of insufficient information that resides at the center of Converse's analysis has not gone away, and that newly fashioned models of information processing offer only partial remedies. Third, I suggest that the concept of the "average voter" is a malicious fiction, as it blinds us to the enormous variation in political attention, interest, and knowledge that characterizes mass publics, in Converse's time as in our own. Fourth, I develop an affirmative aspect of Converse's analysis that has mostly been overlooked: namely, that if ideological reasoning is beyond most citizens' capacity and interest, they might fall back on a simple and reasonable alternative, which I will call "group-centrism." And fifth, I consider the possibility that while the majority of individual citizens falls short of democratic standards, the public as a whole might do rather well. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

These leading scholars, each representing diverse academic traditions, have developed a unified approach to valid descriptive and causal inference in qualitative research, where numerical measurement is either impossible or undesirable. Their book demonstrates that the same logic of inference underlies both good quantitative and good qualitative research designs, and their approach applies equally to each.Providing precepts intended to stimulate and discipline thought, the authors explore issues related to framing research questions, measuring the accuracy of data and uncertainty of empirical inferences, discovering causal effects, and generally improving qualitative research. Among the specific topics they address are interpretation and inference, comparative case studies, constructing causal theories, dependent and explanatory variables, the limits of random selection, selection bias, and errors in measurement. Mathematical notation is occasionally used to clarify concepts, but no prior knowledge of mathematics or statistics is assumed. The unified logic of inference that this book explicates will be enormously useful to qualitative researchers of all traditions and substantive fields.},

In contrast, leadership is arguably one of the most important themes in the social sciences, permeating all aspects of human social affairs: the election of Barack Obama, the war in Iraq, and the collapse of the banks are all high-profile events that draw our attention to the fundamental role of leadership and followership. Converging ideas and developments in both the natural and social sciences suggest that leadership and followership share common properties across humans and other animals, pointing to ancient roots and evolutionary origins. Here, we draw upon key insights from the animal and human literature to lay the foundation for a new science of leadership inspired by an evolutionary perspective. Identifying the origins of human leadership and followership, as well as which aspects are shared with other animals and which are unique, offers ways of understanding, predicting, and improving leadership today.},

Most studies conceptualize credibility in terms of expertise associated with credentials. In settler societies such as Canada, claims are made that indigenous knowledge is a distinct form of knowledge. This study investigates whether and how respondents evaluate the credibility of indigenous elders making claims based on indigenous knowledge compared to scientists making claims based on peer-reviewed research.},

It assesses the progress made since Bryant's 1995 study, published in this Journal, which found practically no reference to electronic privacy protection in Canadian agreements. Specifically, the article reports on a content analysis of existing Canadian collective agreements to determine the extent to which privacy has been recognized by trade unions; to examine which sectors, industries, or individual unions have incorporated surveillance protection into their collective agreements; and to identify specific models of surveillance protection clauses in collective agreements.},

In a process of generalization and transposition, people apply the kinds of reasoning, heuristics, and problem-solving techniques they learn and use at work in all realms of life. In this article, we briefly discuss the dimensionality of the political preference space and then explicate our account that links work experiences with attitudes. We use European Social Survey data to establish correlations between work experiences and attitudes and find evidence that is consistent with our account.},

This article argues that the interaction of education and income provides a more insightful---and stark---display of this change than treating them individually. Each group of voters is associated with distinctive ``first dimension'' views of economic redistribution and ``second dimension'' preferences concerning salient sociopolitical issues of civic and cultural liberties, race, and immigration. Macro-level hypotheses are developed about the changing voting behavior of education-income voting groups along with micro-level hypotheses about the propensity of vote switching. The hypotheses are tested with data from the American National Election Studies 1952--2016. A profound realignment is revealed between (groups of) white voters and the two main US parties that is consistent with the theoretical expectations developed in the article.},

  abstract = {Controversies about biotechnologics often centre not so much on present scientific facts as on speculations about risks and benefits in the future. It is this key futuristic element in these arguments that is the focus of this article. We examine how competing visions of utopia or dystopia are defended through the use of diverse vocabularies, metaphors, associations and appeals to authority. Our case study explores how these rhetorical processes play out in the debate about embryo stem cell research in UK national press and TV news media. The findings show how predictions from those in favour of embryo stem cell research are supported by both hype and by anti-hype, by inconsistent appeals to the technologies' innovative status and by the selective deconstruction of concepts such as 'potential' and 'hope'. The debate also mobilises binary oppositions around reason versus emotion, science versus religion and fact versus fiction. This article highlights how traditional assertions of expertise are now combined with ideas about compassion and respect for democracy and diversity. It also highlights the fact that although news reporters are often responding to topical events the real focus is often on years, even decades ahead. Close attention to how images of the future are constructed, and the evolution of new strategies for legitimation are, we suggest, important areas of on-going research, particularly in discussions of scientific and medical developments and policy.

Using Danish local politics as a case study, this analysis of election report data demonstrates that the political parties show substantial rational actor behaviour when deciding the number of candidates to be put forward. The number of candidates running at Danish local elections has for the last four decades been continuously decreasing. Applying demand-side hypotheses derived from Rational Choice Institutionalism led to the conclusion that some, but not all, of the decline in the number of candidates can be attributed to changes in the institutional set-up of the Danish local elections.}

  abstract = {Mass media play an especially important role in democratic societies. They are presupposed to act as intermediary vehicles that reflect public opinion, respond to public concerns and make the electorate cognizant of state policies, important events and viewpoints. The fundamental principles of democracy depend upon the notion of a reasonably informed electorate. The `propaganda model' of media operations laid out and applied by Edward Herman and Noam Chomsky in Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media postulates that elite media interlock with other institutional sectors in ownership, management and social circles, effectively circumscribing their ability to remain analytically detached from other dominant institutional sectors. The model argues that the net result of this is self-censorship without any significant coercion. Media, according to this framework, do not have to be controlled nor does their behaviour have to be patterned, as it is assumed that they are integral actors in class warfare, fully integrated into the institutional framework of society, and act in unison with other ideological sectors, i.e. the academy, to establish, enforce, reinforce and `police' corporate hegemony. It is not a surprise, then, given the interrelations of the state and corporate capitalism and the `ideological network', that the propaganda model has been dismissed as a `conspiracy theory' and condemned for its `overly deterministic' view of media behaviour. It is generally excluded from scholarly debates on patterns of media behaviour. This article provides a critical assessment and review of Herman and Chomsky's propaganda model and seeks to encourage scholarly debate regarding the relationship between corporate power and ideology. Highly descriptive in nature, the article is concerned with the question of whether media can be seen to play a hegemonic role in society oriented towards legitimization, political accommodation and ideological management.},

Results are reported from a study in the Netherlands among 1706 workers in five employment statuses that differ in degree of security. The perceived probability and severity of job loss were assessed, as were five possible consequences of subjective insecurity. The article shows that (1) job insecurity reflects the `objective' conditions people are in; (2) the appraisal of job insecurity results from the functioning of the probability and severity of job loss; and (3) probability and severity have different consequences depending on employment status.},

To what extent are the public concerned about the virus, and to what extent have the public adopted Zika conspiracy theories? Using data from the 2016 Cooperative Congressional Election Study, we show that a majority of Americans are not concerned about the Zika virus, but approximately one in five Americans believes in at least one Zika-related conspiracy theory. The most widely believed is that the virus is caused by genetically modified mosquitoes. We find that elevated levels of conspiracy thinking are correlated with both concern over Zika and belief in Zika-related conspiracy theories. For example, a person scoring the maximum on the conspiratorial thinking scale is estimated to believe in .61 Zika conspiracy theories while a person scoring the minimum is estimated to believe in only .06 Zika conspiracy theories. This study demonstrates the role of predispositions, specifically underlying conspiracy thinking, in the acceptance of conspiratorial and unscientific beliefs.},

  abstract = {Policy Points: Worldwide, more than 70\% of all deaths are attributable to noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), nearly half of which are premature and apply to individuals of working age. Although such deaths are largely preventable, effective solutions continue to elude the public health community. One reason is the considerable influence of the ``commercial determinants of health'': NCDs are the product of a system that includes powerful corporate actors, who are often involved in public health policymaking. This article shows how a complex systems perspective may be used to analyze the commercial determinants of NCDs, and it explains how this can help with (1) conceptualizing the problem of NCDs and (2) developing effective policy interventions. Context The high burden of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) is politically salient and eminently preventable. However, effective solutions largely continue to elude the public health community. Two pressing issues heighten this challenge: the first is the public health community's narrow approach to addressing NCDs, and the second is the involvement of corporate actors in policymaking. While NCDs are often conceptualized in terms of individual-level risk factors, we argue that they should be reframed as products of a complex system. This article explores the value of a systems approach to understanding NCDs as an emergent property of a complex system, with a focus on commercial actors. Methods Drawing on Donella Meadows's systems thinking framework, this article examines how a systems perspective may be used to analyze the commercial determinants of NCDs and, specifically, how unhealthy commodity industries influence public health policy. Findings Unhealthy commodity industries actively design and shape the NCD policy system, intervene at different levels of the system to gain agency over policy and politics, and legitimize their presence in public health policy decisions. Conclusions It should be possible to apply the principles of systems thinking to other complex public health issues, not just NCDs. Such an approach should be tested and refined for other complex public health challenges.},

We apply Mary Douglas' cultural theory to rural waterpoint management and discuss its operationalisation in pluralist arrangements through networking different management cultures at scale. The theory is tested in coastal Kenya, an area that typifies the challenges faced across Africa in providing rural communities with safely managed water. Drawing on findings from a longitudinal study of 3500 households, we examine how different management cultures face and manage operational, financial, institutional and environmental risks. This paper makes the case for cooperative solutions across systems where current policy effectively separates communities from the state or markets. The contribution of this research is both a theoretical and empirical case to consider pluralist institutional arrangements that enable risks and responsibilities to be re-conceptualised and re-allocated between the state, market and communities to create value for rural water users.},

This entry begins with a definition of colonialism, andthe second section explains how European thinkers justified,legitimized, and challenged the conquest of the Americas. The thirdsection focuses on liberalism and the fourth section briefly discussesthe Marxist tradition, including Marx's own defense of Britishcolonialism in India and Lenin's anti-imperialist writings. Thefifth section provides an introduction to contemporary``post-colonial theory.'' This approach has beenparticularly influential in literary studies because it drawsattention to the diverse ways that postcolonial subjectivities areconstituted and resisted through discursive practices. The finalsection will introduce Indigenous critiques of settler-colonialismthat emerge as a response to colonial practices of domination anddispossession of land, customs and traditional history and topost-colonial theories of universalism.

Once Canada's natural governing party but now confined to the opposition benches, it struggles to renew itself {\dbend} presumably without the support of the provincial-level Liberal parties.

This insider's view of Liberal party politics not only challenges the idea that Canada has two distinct political spheres {\dbend} the provincial and the national {\dbend} it suggests that national parties can overcome the challenges of multi-level politics, strengthen their ties to provincial politics, and deepen their legitimacy by tapping the activism, energy, and support of constituency associations and local campaigns.},

The authors conduct two analyses. The first analysis employs an original data set covering all post-1945 democratic national elections. The second studies individual-level data from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems and British, Canadian, and US national election studies. The results strongly support the generational change and elective institutions hypotheses, which account for most of the decline in voter turnout. These findings have important implications for a better understanding of the current transformations of representative democracy and the challenges it faces.},

  abstract = {The FDA recently announced concern about the safety of bisphenol A (BPA) and the need for more research. In the current controversy, scant attention is being paid to toxicity at the fundamental, molecular level, which is the topic of this report. Important information is provided by extensive studies on metabolism. The principal pathway is detoxification, mainly by conjugation leading to a glucuronide. A minor route entails oxidation by hydroxylation to a catechol followed by further transformation to an o-quinone. The catechol-o-quinone couple is capable of redox cycling with generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress (OS). o-Quinones are highly electron affinic with very favorable reduction potentials that permit electron transfer (ET) under physiological conditions. Only small amounts are sufficient to generate large quantities of ROS catalytically. There is extensive evidence for production of ROS, which buttresses ET by o-quinone as a plausible source. In addition, there are numerous reports on toxicity to body constituents by BPA. Those adversely affected include the liver, DNA, genes, CNS, reproductive system and kidney. Since a plethora of prior studies links ROS-OS with toxicity, it is reasonable to propose a similar connection for BPA. Cell signaling also plays a role. There are various other factors involved with toxic responses, including age, with the fetus and infants being the most vulnerable. A report concludes that human exposure to BPA is not negligible. The present overview represents a novel, integrated approach to BPA toxicity. A similar article was recently published in this journal which deals with toxicity of prevalent phthalate plasticizers.}

  abstract = {Populism has been on the rise for some time in Europe now, and its rise has been one of the key concerns of Peter Mair. He has linked it to the increasing erosion of the representative function of European party systems. The spectre that haunted him was `partyless democracy', a democratic regime where parties had lost their representative function, which opened the door for unmediated populist protest. While largely sharing his interpretation of the overall structural trends giving rise to the populist challenges in Western Europe, the article is critical of the static character of his assessment. It suggests that there are three forms of `protest populism', all of which may eventually end up transforming the West European party systems in the name of the new structuring conflicts that characterise contemporary European societies. In addition, it proposes to extend the scope of Peter's argument to the less established democracies of Central and Eastern Europe.}

Two disputes can be identified in the literature: (1) whether to provide respondents with a small or large number of answer categories, and (2) whether or not to administer the response scale including a midpoint. This study evaluates the performance of the 101, 11, and 10-point left--right scales, which directly speak to the two disputed aspects of measuring the left--right dimension. Drawing on data from a split ballot multitrait multimethod experiment carried out in a methodological pretest to the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), the analysis shows that the choice of a response format makes a difference in terms of data quality: the 11-point left--right scale produces the highest validity of left--right data closely followed by the 10-point scale. Moreover, an application from electoral research illustrates that the choice of response formats affects substantive interpretations about the nature of the left--right dimension. Since all three scales perform about equally well in terms of reliability and the ease of administration, the findings suggest that the 11-point left--right scale should be used in survey research.},

According to our theory of priming, the more attention media pay to a particular domain--the more the public is primed with it--the more citizens will incorporate what they know about that domain into their overall judgment of the president. Data from the 1986 National Election Study confirm that intervention in Central America loomed larger in the public's assessment of President Reagan's performance after the Iran-Contra disclosure than before. Priming was most pronounced for aspects of public opinion most directly implicated by the news coverage, more apparent in political notices' judgments than political experts', and stronger in the evaluations of Reagan's overall performance than in assessments of his character.},

  abstract = {Much research has suggested that citizens' political party affiliations are more persistent over time and more psychologically consequential than are their attitudes toward government policies. However, most surveys have measured party identification with branching questions in which all response alternatives were verbally labeled, whereas policy preferences have typically been measured using nonbranching questions with incomplete verbal labeling of response alternatives. We report eight experiments, involving telephone interviewing, face-to-face interviewing, and self-administered questionnaires, demonstrating that fully labeled branching measures of party identification and policy attitudes are more reliable than partially labeled nonbranching measures of those attitudes. This difference seems to be attributable to effects of both verbal labeling and branching. Thus, it appears that previous findings regarding differences between party identification and policy preferences are partly due to the failure to equate the formats of survey questions measuring those attitudes.},

Using quantitative and qualitative approaches, we find an increase in research over the past 10 years and consistently find that pro-attitudinal media exacerbates polarization. We find a hyperfocus on analyses of Twitter and American samples and a lack of research exploring ways (social) media can depolarize. Additionally, we find ideological and affective polarization are not clearly defined, nor consistently measured. Recommendations for future research are provided.},

  abstract = {Much recent political psychology scholarship has examined the role of anxiety in vote choice. This work generally argues that anxiety affects vote choice indirectly by causing citizens to more thoroughly search for and process political information. This indirect effect of anxiety leads citizens to rely less on heuristics, such as party, and more on substantive information, such as policy positions. The most prominent example of this scholarship is the Affective Intelligence (AI) theory of emotions. In this paper, we use cross-sectional and panel survey data to test AI against two simpler alternatives: (1) that emotions directly influence candidate evaluations and (2) that candidate evaluations directly influence emotions. We first show that these simpler alternatives can produce the complex, cross-sectional interactions that provide the principal support for AI. Then, using panel data to better assess causal direction, we find little support for AI, some evidence that emotions directly influence candidate evaluations, and strong evidence that candidate evaluations directly influence emotions. Scholars, we conclude, should be hesitant to abandon these simpler explanations in favor of AI.},

  abstract = {As recently as the early 1970s, the news media was one of the most respected institutions in the United States. Yet by the 1990s, this trust had all but evaporated. Why has confidence in the press declined so dramatically over the past 40 years? And has this change shaped the public's political behavior? This book examines waning public trust in the institutional news media within the context of the American political system and looks at how this lack of confidence has altered the ways people acquire political information and form electoral preferences. Jonathan Ladd argues that in the 1950s, '60s, and early '70s, competition in American party politics and the media industry reached historic lows. When competition later intensified in both of these realms, the public's distrust of the institutional media grew, leading the public to resist the mainstream press's information about policy outcomes and turn toward alternative partisan media outlets. As a result, public beliefs and voting behavior are now increasingly shaped by partisan predispositions. Ladd contends that it is not realistic or desirable to suppress party and media competition to the levels of the mid-twentieth century; rather, in the contemporary media environment, new ways to augment the public's knowledgeability and responsiveness must be explored. Drawing on historical evidence, experiments, and public opinion surveys, this book shows that in a world of endless news sources, citizens' trust in institutional media is more important than ever before.},

  abstract = {Polar bears are important socio-cultural symbols in the communities of the Eeyou Marine Region (EMR) in northwestern Qu{\'e}bec, Canada. Members of the Cree communities in this region are generally not active polar bear hunters, but they encounter polar bears when fishing, trapping, or hunting during the ice-free season. A growing body of scientific evidence suggests that reduced annual sea ice cover in Hudson Bay has led to declines in body condition of polar bears in the local Southern Hudson Bay subpopulation and to a population decline in the neighboring Western Hudson Bay subpopulation. In June 2012, we conducted 15 semi-directed interviews on the subject of polar bear biology and climate change with local elders and hunters in three communities in the northern EMR: Wemindji, Chisasibi, and Whapmagoostui. The interviews held in Whapmagoostui included informants from Kuujjuarapik, the adjacent Inuit community. The interviews addressed knowledge gaps in the Recovery Strategy for Polar Bear in Ontario. Transcripts of the interviews were coded thematically and analyzed using both qualitative and quantitative methods. The interviews revealed important insights into polar bear distribution, terrestrial habitat use, denning, and foraging patterns. Participants were unanimous in their recognition of a warming climate and prolonged ice-free season in the area in recent years. However, communities differed in their observations on other issues, with latitudinal trends evident in observations of polar bear distribution, denning activity, and foraging habits. Communities also differed in their perception of the prevalence of problem polar bears and the conservation status of the species, with one-third of participants reporting that polar bears will be unaffected by, or even benefit from, longer ice-free periods. A majority of participants indicated that the local polar bear population was stable or increasing. Interviewees also identified future research priorities pertinent to the communities, and provided comments on the methods employed by polar bear biologists. Our results demonstrate that communities in the EMR have important knowledge about polar bear ecology and illustrate the unique opportunities and challenges of combining traditional ecological knowledge with wildlife science in the context of a rapidly changing subarctic environment. L'ours blanc rev{\^e}t un caract{\`e}re socioculturel important pour les communaut{\'e}s de la R{\'e}gion marine d'Eeyou (RME), situ{\'e}e dans le nord-ouest de la province de Qu{\'e}bec, au Canada. Bien que les Cris de ces communaut{\'e}s ne soient pas reconnus pour chasser particuli{\`e}rement l'ours blanc, ils partagent le territoire avec l'ours blanc lors de leurs d{\'e}placements et activit{\'e}s de chasse, de p{\^e}che et de trappe. Un nombre croissant de preuves scientifiques sugg{\`e}re que la r{\'e}duction annuelle de la couverture de glace dans la baie d'Hudson aurait caus{\'e} une d{\'e}gradation de la condition physique des ours blancs de la sous-population sud de la baie d'Hudson et un d{\'e}clin de la sous-population voisine, dans l'ouest de la baie d'Hudson. En juin 2012, nous avons r{\'e}alis{\'e} une s{\'e}rie de 15 entrevues semi-dirig{\'e}es concernant la biologie de l'ours blanc et les changements climatiques avec des a{\^i}n{\'e}s et des chasseurs de trois communaut{\'e}s de la portion nordique de la RME : Wemindji, Chisasibi et Whapmagoostui. Les entrevues tenues {\`a} Whapmagoostui ont inclus des r{\'e}pondants du village inuit adjacent, Kuujjuarapik. Les entrevues abordaient des lacunes au niveau des connaissances, telles que d{\'e}termin{\'e}es par le Programme de r{\'e}tablissement de l'ours polaire en Ontario. Les entrevues ont {\'e}t{\'e} transcrites et cod{\'e}es par th{\`e}mes afin d'{\^e}tre analys{\'e}es suivant des m{\'e}thodes qualitatives et quantitatives. Les entrevues r{\'e}v{\`e}lent d'importantes informations relativement aux connaissances sur la distribution, l'utilisation des habitats terrestres, les aires de mise bas et les habitudes alimentaires des ours blancs. Les participants ont unanimement constat{\'e} le r{\'e}chauffement du climat et la prolongation de la p{\'e}riode libre de glace au cours des derni{\`e}res ann{\'e}es sur leur territoire d'activit{\'e}s. Cependant, les points de vue des participants diff{\`e}rent pour ce qui est de certains enjeux, selon un gradient latitudinal {\'e}vident, concernant la distribution, les activit{\'e}s de mise bas et les habitudes alimentaires de l'esp{\`e}ce. Les perceptions des communaut{\'e}s diff{\`e}rent aussi relativement {\`a} la pr{\'e}valence des ours blancs probl{\'e}matiques et en ce qui concerne le statut de conservation de l'esp{\`e}ce, avec le tiers des participants jugeant que les ours blancs ne seraient pas affect{\'e}s, ou pourraient m{\^e}me b{\'e}n{\'e}ficier, d'une plus longue p{\'e}riode libre de glace. Une majorit{\'e} de participants indique que la population locale d'ours blancs est stable ou en augmentation. Enfin, les r{\'e}pondants ont indiqu{\'e} les priorit{\'e}s de recherches pertinentes {\`a} leur communaut{\'e} et partag{\'e} des commentaires sur les m{\'e}thodes employ{\'e}es par les biologistes.

  abstract = {In Greenland, polar bears (Ursus maritimus) are nutritional, economic, and cultural subsistence resources for Inuit. Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) collected from subsistence hunters can provide important insights and improve management decisions when collected systematically. We report on the results of a TEK survey of subsistence polar bear hunters living in the areas around Tasiilaq and Ittoqqortoormiit, East Greenland. Twenty-five full-time polar bear hunters were interviewed between December 2014 and March 2015 in a conversation-style interview, where a local interviewer fluent in the East Greenlandic dialect asked a series of 55 predetermined questions. The primary goals were to 1) gather Inuit perspectives on polar bear subsistence quotas and hunting strategies, 2) understand how climate change is affecting the polar bear subsistence hunt, and 3) document observed changes in polar bear distribution, abundance, and biology. Approximately 40\% of the Tasiilaq respondents had caught between 10-19 polar bears in their lifetime, while 67\% of Ittoqqortoormiit respondents reported lifetime catches of {$>$}20 bears. In both areas, polar bears were most commonly hunted between February and April. Hunters noted large changes to the climate in the areas where they hunt polar bears. Most hunters reported loss of sea ice, receding glaciers, unstable weather, and warmer temperatures. In Tasiilaq 73\% of the hunters said climate changes had affected the polar bear hunt and in Ittoqqortoormiit about 88\% of respondents reported the same. Hunters indicated that sea ice loss has created more areas of open water so dog sledges have become unsafe for hunting transportation compared to 10-15 years ago (reported by 100\% of hunters in Tasiilaq and 80\% in Ittoqqortoormiit). In both areas hunters noted that more polar bears are coming into their communities compared to 10-15 years ago (81\% of Tasiilaq hunters and 78\% of Ittoqqortoormiit hunters) and pointed to the introduction of quotas and loss of sea ice as potential reasons. This study provides an important perspective on the East Greenland subpopulation of polar bears that can be used to direct science questions and inform management.},

Two dimensions of political knowledge were measured: factual knowledge, in which respondents were asked to name the 10 provincial premiers; and conceptual knowledge, in terms of respondents' abilities to define and use the concepts of left and right. The authors tested four explanations of people's levels of political knowledge; these dealt with education, political participation, media effects and region, with controls for income, residency in several provinces, age and sex. Education was significantly associated with both forms of knowledge, but especially with conceptual knowledge. Reading about politics in newspapers and magazines was strongly related to the two knowledge variables. The effects of reliance on television for political information, however, were much weaker. There were significant effects for region, with the patterns depending on the type of knowledge. The study concludes with some observations about the role of knowledge in political behaviour., Cette {\'e}tude cherche {\`a} conna{\^i}tre les sources des connaissances politiques en utilisant les donn{\'e}es d'une {\'e}tude de l'{\'e}lection f{\'e}d{\'e}rale de 1984.

Sont consid{\'e}r{\'e}es les diff{\'e}rences interprovinciales, et l'influence du statut socio-{\'e}onomique (sse) et de certaines variables psycho-sociales sur le niveau du vcs. Notre analyse indique que le vcs est g{\'e}n{\'e}ralement plus {\'e}lev{\'e} lors d{\'e}ections provinciales que f{\'e}d{\'e}rales. Il tend aussi {\`a}{\^e}tre {\'e}lev{\'e} pour les deux types d{\'e}lections en Colombie Britannique, en Saskatchewan et au Manitoba, et tr{\`e}s bas au Qu{\'e}bec. Lorsqu'on ajoute des variables subjectives (i.e., le r{\'e}pondant se dit-il de gauche ou de droite) {\`a} celles, objectives, reli{\'e}es au sse la pertinence du vcs est grandement renforc{\'e}e. De tels r{\'e}sultats appellent leurs propres questions, quant aux moyens de maximiser ou minimiser le vote de classe, et au statut th{\'e}orique de ce dernier au sein des th{\'e}ories du vote. Using data from the 1984 Canadian National Election Study, we tested predictions about the comparative levels of subjective class voting (scv) in provincial and federal elections, interprovincial differences in scv, and the contributions of ses and selected social psychological intervening variables to the explanation of scv. We found, in general, more evidence of scv in provincial elections than in federal elections. Also, provincial and federal scv was generally highest in British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, and lowest in Quebec. Finally, the addition of two social psychological variables (respondents' social class self-placements and self-descriptions on a left/right political orientation rating scale) to the standard objective ses indicators (occupation, income and education) greatly increased the total variance explained in scv. We conclude with some observations about the circumstances under which class voting will be maximized vs. minimized, and about the desirability of viewing the specialized problem of class voting within the larger context of voting theory.},

For instance, there will probably be more steelworker delegates at the Dec. 3 leadership convention in Winnipeg than delegates from B.C. In fact, nearly a third of the voting delegates are expected to be union delegates as opposed to straight party delegates. The chance to vote for one of their own, even one as controversial as White, has to be taken seriously.              Certainly White will not fare well with western delegates. They will seek either a native son or daughter to lead the party, or someone who represents the party's national interest. The industrial heartland of Ontario will be a happy hunting ground for White, although the province will throw up a few political candidates of its own. Quebec, with its tradition of strong unions, may or may not support White. The Maritime provinces, without a single NDP member of Parliament to boast of in the Commons, may also prove to be amenable to a White leadership bid.},

Traditionally, point interpolation is applied to isarithmic, that is, contour mapping and areal interpolation to isopleth mapping. Recently, areal interpolation techniques have been used to obtain data for a set of administrative or political districts from another set of districts whose boundaries do not coincide. For point interpolation, the numerous methods may further be classified into exact and approximate. Exact methods include most distance-weighting methods, Kriging, spline interpolation, interpolating polynomials, and finite-difference methods. Approximate methods include power-series trend models, Fourier models, distance-weighted least-squares, and least-squares fitting with splines. Areal interpolation methods, on the other hand, are classified according to whether they preserve volume. Traditional areal interpolation methods which utilize point interpolation procedures are not volume-preserving, whereas the map overlay and pycnophylactic methods are. It is shown that methods possessing the volume-preserving property generally outperform those that do not.},

These findings suggest that it is the way think tanks mediate the power structures of modern societies that can explain the convergence and cohesion of their policy ideas and political identities. The centrist think tank achieves its `centrism' by catering to dominant interests and the state while extending a hand to `middle powers.' The more activist think tanks maintain more homogenous communities by securing ties to specific interests and particular intellectual/ideological commitments.},

Compared to the private sector branch of the new middle class, the public sector branch was more egalitarian, slightly more supportive of pan-Canadian nationalism, more likely to support the New Democratic Party, and more active in politics. However, there was little difference between the sectors on class identification, support for cuts in military spending, and postmaterialist values. The cleavage on political activism was due to the higher levels of education in the public sector, while occupational-and sectoral-level factors interacted to produce the other sectoral differences in new middle class politics. The article concludes by considering the prospects for left politics in Canada in light of the diminishing size and autonomy of the public sector branch of the new middle class and the conservatism of the private sector branch. /// Cet article rend compte d'une {\'e}tude qui visait {\`a} d{\'e}terminer (1) dans quelle mesure il existe un clivage dans les affinit{\'e}s politiques au sein de la nouvelle classe moyenne au Canada selon que les gens sont employ{\'e}s dans le secteur public ou le secteur priv{\'e}, et (2) s'il existe des donn{\'e}es {\`a} l'appui des cinq facteurs postul{\'e}s comme sources de ce clivage. L'{\'e}tude s'appuyait sur le Class Structure Project de 1982 et sur la National Election Study de 1988.

First, we test this model for the overall electorate. Then, we divide our sample between voters who do and do not hold government economic policies responsible for fluctuations in personal and national well-being. We find that retrospective economic judgments have the stronger and more consistent impact on voting behavior in nearly every case.

The implications of section 94 have been overlooked partly because judges are ill-disposed to arguments based upon the structure of the BNA Act, and partly because of Frank Scott's misleading essay on the subject. Scott's centralist interpretation of section 94 is untenable, largely because that section does not restrict provincial sovereignty or federalism but gives constitutional recognition to them. Section 94 also implies a formal amending procedure of unanimity: neither unilateral action by the federal Parliament nor substantial provincial consent has any application to the division of powers. Since the centralist interpretation of the Canadian constitution cannot be reconciled with a significant provision of the BNA Act, a conception of Canadian federalism is required which gives greater recognition to the constitutional autonomy of the provinces., Le jugement de la Cour Supr{\^e}me sur I'amendement constitutionnel a rendu possible, puis sanctionn{\'e}, un compromis politique en opposition avec la logique de la seule disposition de l'A.A.N.B. concemant les amendements au partage des pouvoirs.

Recent formal theories of voter turnout emphasize a positive effect of being informed on the propensity to vote, but the possibility of endogenous information acquisition makes estimation of causal effects difficult. I estimate the causal effects of being informed on voter turnout using unique data from a natural experiment Copenhagen referendum on decentralization. Four of fifteen districts carried out a pilot project, exogenously making pilot city district voters more informed about the effects of decentralization. Empirical estimates based on survey data confirm a sizeable and statistically significant causal effect of being informed on the propensity to vote.},

  abstract = {Despite an extensive dialogue on the subject of immigration, there has been little systematic cross-national investigation into the framing of immigration in the news media. Understanding the evolution of frames is an important piece of how we conceive of the link between the public's political priorities and policy makers' responses. While the multi-directional relationships that exist between media, public policy and public opinion often pose challenges to precisely extracting media effects, there is still much that can be said about how the content and tone of immigration frames change over time in response to major policy changes or focusing events. Using automated content analysis (ACA) of print news data from Canada and Britain, I examine immigration framing from 1999 to 2013, identifying immigration-related frames in print news coverage and identifying trends in the volume and tone of frames over time. Results offer insight into striking commonalities in the frames used by each country's print media, and the divergent evolution in the emphasis on certain frames over others, largely predicated on coverage of focusing events. Malgr{\'e} un dialogue expansif au sujet de l'immigration, il y a eu jusqu'ici peu de recherche transnationale syst{\'e}matique sur le cadrage de l'immigration dans les m{\'e}dias. Comprendre l'{\'e}volution des cadres est un point essentiel de la mani{\`e}re dont on con{\c c}oit le lien entre les priorit{\'e}s politiques du public et les r{\'e}ponses des d{\'e}cideurs. Bien que les relations multidirectionnelles existant entre m{\'e}dias, politiques publiques et opinion publique repr{\'e}sentent un d{\'e}fi pour discerner les effets des m{\'e}dias, il reste encore beaucoup {\`a} dire sur la mani{\`e}re dont le contenu et le ton des cadres de l'immigration {\'e}voluent dans le temps, en r{\'e}ponse aux changements majeurs de politiques ou {\'e}v{\'e}nements politiques. En utilisant une analyse de contenu automatis{\'e}e (ACA) de la presse {\'e}crite canadienne et britannique, j'examine le cadrage de l'immigration de 1999 {\`a} 2013, en identifiant les cadres reli{\'e}s {\`a} l'immigration dans la couverture m{\'e}diatique de la presse {\'e}crite ainsi que les tendances dans le volume et le ton de ces cadres {\`a} travers le temps. Les r{\'e}sultats offrent un aper{\c c}u des points communs frappants dans les cadres utilis{\'e}s par la presse {\'e}crite des deux pays, mais aussi de l'{\'e}volution divergente dans l'emphase de certains cadres par rapport {\`a} d'autres, largement fond{\'e} sur la couverture d'{\'e}v{\'e}nements politiques.}

Yet, recent studies suggest that framing effects may also be mediated by emotional response. The role of specific emotions in mediating the framing effect process, however, has yet to be fully empirically investigated. In an experimental survey design (n = 161), this study tests two positive (enthusiasm and contentment) and two negative emotions (anger and fear) as mediators of framing effects. Our results show that while anger and enthusiasm mediate a framing effect, contentment and fear do not. These findings deepen our understanding of which discrete emotions are relevant when studying mediated framing effects.},

  abstract = {To the casual foreign observer, Canada's 34th federal election held on 21 November 1988 might have seemed a predictable affair. A Progressive-Conservative government led by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, which had been confidently planning its political agenda around an autumn election call, won a comfortable majority of seats. A Liberal party, which had stumbled from disaster to disaster under the uneven leadership of John Turner, polled fewer than a third of the votes cast. And a resurgent New Democratic party, led by the popular and seasoned Ed Broadbent, achieved a record tally of 43 seats, even though it remained a clear third in overall support. The fact that there is so little that is remarkable about these results would engender shocked surprise upon learning that this election was perhaps the most dramatic of the century, involving issues of overriding national importance and an outcome that remained uncertain until the very end. The Great Free Trade Election of 1988, as it will almost certainly be remembered by many observers and participants, provided moments of incomparable political drama.}

While Canada has not been immune to these trends, populism has enjoyed relatively little electoral success in modern Canadian politics. A new People's Party fielded candidates in the 2019 and 2021 federal elections but failed to win any seats in Parliament. Some populist themes such as nativism or authoritarianism have not rewarded their proponents in Canadian elections. Another dimension, distrust of elites, politicians and the media, is more present in Canadian public opinion today, and was a part of past populist movements such as Social Credit or Reform. In this paper, we examine the structure and correlates of populist attitudes held by Canadians, utilizing data from the 2019 and 2021 Canadian Election Studies. In conclusion, we consider the potential for a populist political party or leader to enjoy electoral success in the Canada of today.},

  abstract = {In this study, we investigate how structural economic changes constrain an equality project, the public-sector expansion strategy. First, we describe a three-stage process in which a growing productivity gap between the private-manufacturing and public-service sectors disrupts traditional class solidarity. We contend that emerging conflicts between private and public sectors due to public-sector expansion and a growing inter-sectoral productivity gap eventually lead to employment and budget crises, as well as the weakening of coordinated wagesetting institutions. Furthermore, political, institutional, and economic transformations originating from sectoral cleavages and imbalance lead to increased income inequality. We test this argument using an unbalanced panel dataset on 16 advanced industrial democracies from 1971 to 2003. We find that public-sector employment has a strong negative effect on income inequality when the productivity gap between sectors is low. In such situations, public-sector employment fulfills its promise of equality and full employment. However, as the inter-sectoral productivity gap increases, the negative effect of public-sector expansion on income inequality evaporates. The findings suggest that severely uneven productivity gaps due to different degrees of technological innovations significantly weaken and limit the effectiveness of left-wing governments' policy interventions through public-service expansion.},

Taking advantage of similar lobbying disclosure rules in the US and Canada, we create a cross-country lobbying dataset. We focus on the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) to control for timing, salience, and issue scope. This helps us attribute differences in firm mobilization and trade lobbying strategies across the two countries to differences in political institutions. Strikingly different USMCA lobbying patterns emerge. Within the same industry, trade associations, the executive branch, and in-house lobbyists play a larger role in Canada. Meanwhile, well-established determinants of US lobbying fail to explain patterns of mobilization and the use of external lobbyists in Canada. These findings provide insights into comparative lobbying studies and indicate that some stylized facts about lobbying are unique features of the US political system.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:In medical informatics, psychology, market research and many other fields, researchers often need to analyze and model ranking data. However, there is no statistical software that provides tools for the comprehensive analysis of ranking data. Here, we present pmr, an R package for analyzing and modeling ranking data with a bundle of tools. The pmr package enables descriptive statistics (mean rank, pairwise frequencies, and marginal matrix), Analytic Hierarchy Process models (with Saaty's and Koczkodaj's inconsistencies), probability models (Luce model, distance-based model, and rank-ordered logit model), and the visualization of ranking data with multidimensional preference analysis. RESULTS:Examples of the use of package pmr are given using a real ranking dataset from medical informatics, in which 566 Hong Kong physicians ranked the top five incentives (1: competitive pressures; 2: increased savings; 3: government regulation; 4: improved efficiency; 5: improved quality care; 6: patient demand; 7: financial incentives) to the computerization of clinical practice. The mean rank showed that item 4 is the most preferred item and item 3 is the least preferred item, and significance difference was found between physicians' preferences with respect to their monthly income. A multidimensional preference analysis identified two dimensions that explain 42\% of the total variance. The first can be interpreted as the overall preference of the seven items (labeled as "internal/external"), and the second dimension can be interpreted as their overall variance of (labeled as "push/pull factors"). Various statistical models were fitted, and the best were found to be weighted distance-based models with Spearman's footrule distance. CONCLUSIONS:In this paper, we presented the R package pmr, the first package for analyzing and modeling ranking data. The package provides insight to users through descriptive statistics of ranking data. Users can also visualize ranking data by applying a thought multidimensional preference analysis. Various probability models for ranking data are also included, allowing users to choose that which is most suitable to their specific situations.},

  author = {Leeper, Thomas J},
  pages = {32},
  abstract = {Applied data analysts regularly need to make use of regression analysis to understand descriptive, predictive, and causal patterns in data. While many applications of ordinary least squares yield estimated regression coefficients that are readily interpretable as the predicted change in y due to a unit change in x, models that involve multiplicative interactions or other complex terms are subject to less clarity of interpretation. Generalized linear models that involve transformations of this linear predictor into binary, ordinal, count or other discrete outcomes lack such ready interpretation. As such, there has been much debate in the literature about how best to interpret these more complex models (e.g., what quantities of interest to extract? what types of graphical presentations to use?). This article proposes that marginal effects, specifically average marginal effects, provide a unified and intuitive way of describing relationships estimated with regression. To begin, I briefly discuss the challenges of interpreting complex models and review existing views on how to interpret such models, before describing average marginal effects and the somewhat challenging computational task of extracting this quantity of interest from regression results. I conclude with implications for statistical practice and for the design of statistical software.},

A party that takes a product-orientation argues for what it stands for and believes in. A Sales-Orientated party focuses on selling its argument and product to voters. A Market-Orientated party designs its behaviour to provide voter satisfaction. Exploring these three orientations demonstrates that political marketing can be applied to a wide range of behaviour and suggests its potential to be applied to several areas of political studies.},

Focusing on the 2007-2008 primary debates and post-debate coverage, I examine how infelicities around The Issues are read as addressivity and used to cast candidates as social types (e.g., ``flip-flopper'').

It examines the reasons for the divide and surveys a variety of attempts to find solutions for the problem of intersection at the boundary between national life and the international environment. It places the dichotomy in a broader context of political science as a whole and offers suggestions about potentially fruitful exchanges. It treats globalization and suggests that a theory of the state could be helpful to both tendencies in policy studies.},

Research on priming revived scholarly interest in campaign and media effects and implied, according to some, that campaigns and the media can manipulate voters. There are, however, alternative explanations for these priming findings, alternatives that previous studies have not fully considered. In this article, I reanalyze four cases of alleged priming, using panel data to test priming effects against these alternatives. Across these four cases, I find little evidence of priming effects. Instead, campaign and media attention to an issue creates the appearance of priming through a two-part process: Exposing individuals to campaign and media messages on an issue (1) informs some of them about the parties' or candidates' positions on that issue. Once informed, (2) these individuals often adopt their preferred party's or candidate's position as their own.},

Two hundred seventy-one seventh graders watched a series of videos in which two interviewees (one expert in the field, one layperson) expressed divergent positions on a socioscientific issue (``Will organic farming be able to feed the entire world population by 2050?''). After watching the videos, students were asked to recall the identity and arguments of the interviewees and indicate how far they had perceived them to be credible and convincing. If no effect of students' prior attitude was found on source recall, students were prompt to judge the interviewee who provided arguments that were congruent with their prior attitude as more credible and convincing that the interviewee that provided incongruent arguments. These results suggest that young students' beliefs contribute to their assessment of the credibility of an information source when watching videos.},

I collect data on the causal chain of media effects: subscriptions to outlets, exposure to news on Facebook, visits to online news sites, and sharing of posts, as well as changes in political opinions and attitudes. Four main findings emerge. First, random variation in exposure to news on social media substantially affects the slant of news sites individuals visit. Second, exposure to counter-attitudinal news decreases negative attitudes toward the opposing political party. Third, in contrast to the effect on attitudes, I find no evidence that the political leanings of news outlets affect political opinions. Fourth, Facebook's algorithm is less likely to supply individuals with posts from counter-attitudinal outlets, conditional on individuals subscribing to them. Together, the results suggest that social media algorithms may limit exposure to counter-attitudinal news and thus increase polarization.},

  abstract = {Today we are politically polarized as never before. The presidential elections of 2000 and 2004 will be remembered as two of the most contentious political events in American history. Yet despite the recent election upheaval, The American Voter Revisited discovers that voter behavior has been remarkably consistent over the last half century. And if the authors are correct in their predictions, 2008 will show just how reliably the American voter weighs in, election after election. The American Voter Revisited re-creates the outstanding 1960 classic The American Voter---which was based on the presidential elections of 1952 and 1956---following the same format, theory, and mode of analysis as the original. In this new volume, the authors test the ideas and methods of the original against presidential election surveys from 2000 and 2004. Surprisingly, the contemporary American voter is found to behave politically much like voters of the 1950s. "Simply essential. For generations, serious students of American politics have kept The American Voter right on their desk. Now, everyone will keep The American Voter Revisited right next to it." ---Larry J. Sabato, Director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics and author of A More Perfect Constitution "The American Voter Revisited is destined to be the definitive volume on American electoral behavior for decades. It is a timely book for 2008, with in-depth analyses of the 2000 and 2004 elections updating and extending the findings of the original The American Voter. It is also quite accessible, making it ideal for graduate students as well as advanced undergrads." ---Andrew E.

  abstract = {Thorlief Schjelderup-Ebbe's seminal paper on the `pecking' order of chickens inspired numerous ethologists to research and debate the phenomenon of dominance. The expansion of dominance to the broader concept of power facilitated disentangling aggression, strength, rank and power. Aggression is only one means of coercing other individuals, and can sometimes highlight a lack of power. The fitness advantages of aggression may only outweigh the costs during periods of uncertainty. Effective instruments of power also include incentives and refusals to act. Moreover, the stability of the power relationship might vary with the instruments used if different means of power vary in the number and types of outcomes achieved, as well as the speed of accomplishing those outcomes. In well-established relationships, actions or physiological responses in the subordinate individual may even be the only indicator of a power differential. A focus on strength, aggression and fighting provides an incomplete understanding of the power landscape that individuals actually experience. Multiple methods for constructing hierarchies exist but greater attention to the implications of the types of data used in these constructions is needed. Many shifts in our understanding of power were foreshadowed in Schjelderup-Ebbe's discussion about deviations from the linear hierarchy in chickens. This article is part of the theme issue `The centennial of the pecking order: current state and future prospects for the study of dominance hierarchies'.},

The recent debate has focused on Donald Savoie's thesis that the concentration of power to the centre has accelerated and ministers have effectively lost their influence on decision making in cabinet. This article identifies two research gaps. First, the study combines both the experiences of federal and provincial cabinet ministers to construct an understanding of Canadian cabinet decision making at both levels of government. Second, the research investigates the new generation of cabinet ministers; no study has yet consulted ministers of the 2000--2010 decade.R{\'e}sum{\'e}.

Incrementalists believe that for complex problem solving it usually means practicing incrementalism more skillfully and turning away from it only rarely. Disjointed incrementalism is one of several possible forms of strategic analysis, and simple incremental analysis is one of several elements in disjointed incremental analysis. One can examine each to see why it should be pursued as an alternative to the pursuit of conventional scientific analysis. Analysts who think in the older conventional way about problem solving pretend to synopsis; but knowing no way to approximate it, they fall into worse patterns of analysis and decision than those who, with their eyes open, entertain the guiding ideal of strategic analysis. The choice between synopsis and disjointed incrementalism, or between synopsis and any form of strategic analysis, is simply between ill-considered, often accidental incompleteness on one hand, and deliberate, designed incompleteness on the other. Incrementalism in politics is not, in principle, slow moving. It is not necessarily a tactic of conservatism. A fast-moving sequence of small changes can more speedily accomplish a drastic alteration of the status quo than can an only infrequent major policy change.},

  abstract = {In both Europe and North America, populist movements have shattered existing party systems and thrown governments into turmoil. The embattled establishment claims that these populist insurgencies seek to overthrow liberal democracy. The truth is no less alarming but is more complex: Western democracies are being torn apart by a new class war. ~ In this controversial and groundbreaking new analysis, Michael Lind, one of America's leading thinkers, debunks the idea that the insurgencies are primarily the result of bigotry, traces how the breakdown of mid-century class compromises between business and labor led to the conflict, and reveals the real battle lines. ~ On one side is the managerial overclass---the university-credentialed elite that clusters in high-income hubs and dominates government, the economy and the culture. On the other side is the working class of the low-density heartlands---mostly, but not exclusively, native and white. ~ The two classes clash over immigration, trade, the environment, and social values, and the managerial class has had the upper hand. As a result of the half-century decline of the institutions that once empowered the working class, power has shifted to the institutions the overclass controls: corporations, executive and judicial branches, universities, and the media.~ ~ The class war can resolve in one of three ways:~~~{$\bullet~$}The triumph of the overclass, resulting in a high-tech caste system.~ ~~~{$\bullet~$}The empowerment of populist, resulting in no constructive reforms ~~~{$\bullet~$}A class compromise that provides the working class with real power  ~ Lind argues that Western democracies must incorporate working-class majorities of all races, ethnicities, and creeds into decision making in politics, the economy, and culture. Only this class compromise can avert a never-ending cycle of clashes between oligarchs and populists and save democracy.},

The council's report also blamed a rebound of the infamous Proposition 13 tax reductions for some serious economic drags. California property taxes went down but the need for schools, libraries, child care and other services did not. Lacking general revenue, the state's towns and cities began demanding that developers pay special fees for any new commercial, residential or industrial project. The report said this was crippling growth. On the other side, the image of "revenue producers" ignores heavy provincial spending - free railway lines for pulp mills, the notorious investment losses that peaked with NovAtel, wage subsidies masquerading as career development programs, training costs which used to be picked up by employers, and much more. A recent study by Irene Ip of the C.D. Howe Institute shows that in the late 1980s, Alberta spent more of its budget on "transfers to business" than any other province.},

Many also looked at the size of the deficit and decided the government would have to turn to higher taxes or user fees in about the third year; some even proposed a sales tax.

A couple of Calgary businessmen decided in one discussion group that government ought to be run more like a business. In another session, Neil Reimer, former provincial NDP leader and now a voice for the Alberta Council on Aging, said governments everywhere have failed to curb debt because 15 years of high interest rates on investments and lower taxes on the rich have worked for some: "That's why we haven't had the political will." Underlying this whole two days is a question which is going politely unspoken, but which is one of the essential ones facing Premier Ralph Klein when he arrives here today: Will anyone believe that Albertans are genuinely worried about their province's huge and swelling debt if they re-elect the PC government which presided over the creation of that debt?},

In particular, they are interested in coverage of international events as an interesting test of whether technological changes are liberating journalists to report far-flung world development with more emphasis on live feeds and less emphasis on officials in highly managed institutional settings providing the framing. An alternative hypothesis suggests that even if live event coverage is on the rise, journalists may quickly bring officials into the news frame, continuing the familiar gatekeeping practice of "officiating" (news management and cueing) those live events. The authors found that event-driven news stories are indeed more common but that officials seem to be as much a part of the news as ever.

However, there is a surprising dearth of research that investigates the nature and causes of this association. Two kinds of explanation are considered, drawing on the literature on populism. One is termed `structuralist', drawing on accounts of the roots of populism in economic and political marginalisation amongst those `left behind' by globalisation and technological change. A second focuses on the ideological content of RWP, especially its antagonism between `the people' and a cosmopolitan elite, with climate change and policy occupying a symbolic place in this contrast. It is argued that there are limits to the structuralist approach, and that an ideologically based explanation is more compelling. An agenda for future research on RWP and climate science and policy is proposed.},

  abstract = {How to study media diversity has become a major concern in today's media landscape. Many expect that algorithmic filtering and a shift of audiences from legacy media to new intermediaries decrease the diversity of news diets, leading to fragmented societies, polarization and spread of misinformation. Different fields, from journalism research to law and computer science, are involved in the study of media diversity. They operate, however, with vastly different vocabularies, frameworks, and measurements. To overcome this fragmentation, this study provides an extensive overview of conceptualizations and operationalizations of media diversity in different fields using a systematic literature review (1999--2018). This showed a lack of theorizing and linking of conceptual with empirical work in media diversity research. Based on this, we develop a framework on how to move forward: Regarding conceptualization, we call for focusing on different places in the journalistic information chain instead of the classical exposure-supply distinction. Methodologically, automated approaches (e.g., analyzing digital traces) and qualitative approaches (e.g., capturing perceptions of diversity) should receive more attention. For analysis, matters of balance and disparity need to be stressed more, especially discussing possible limits to diversity. Overall, research into media diversity thus needs to be addressed in interdisciplinary collaboration.},

  abstract = {If you are trying to persuade someone, expressing your opinion with certainty intuitively seems like a good strategy to maximize your influence. However, Karmarkar and Tormala (2010) found that the effectiveness of this tactic depends on expertise. In three experiments, Karmarkar and Tormala found support for an incongruity hypothesis, whereby non-expert sources can gain interest and influence by expressing certainty, while expert sources can increase persuasion by expressing uncertainty. In this Registered Report, we conducted a high-powered (N~=~1018) direct replication of Experiment 2 by Karmarkar and Tormala (2010). In a consumer behaviour context, the original study examined whether source expertise moderated the positive effect of source certainty on the persuasive impact of a restaurant recommendation. The present replication failed to find support for the incongruity hypothesis, {$\eta$}p2~=~0.00 [0.00, 0.02]: expressing certainty had a positive but non-significant effect for non-experts, d~=~0.10 [-0.10, 0.34], and a positive effect for experts, d~=~0.28 [0.03, 0.52]. Instead, the results supported the competing confidence heuristic hypothesis that expressed certainty would have a positive effect on persuasion, irrespective of source expertise, d~=~0.18 [0.01, 0.36]. Extending the original work, we (1) controlled for the reason given for (un)certainty, and (2) examined need for closure as a potential individual difference moderator. The results indicated robust support for the confidence heuristic d~=~0.25, [0.12, 0.37], but neither reason for (un)certainty nor need for closure moderated the effect as hypothesized.

Five blocks of items in the questionnaire in the sixth round of the European Social Survey (2012) are used in the analysis. These data also allow for an evaluation of the differences between countries in terms of non-differentiation and straightlining. Five different measurements of these aspects of response style are used in the analysis. To disentangle the impact of respondents and interviewers on these aspects of response style, a three-level random intercept model is specified. The results clearly show interviewer effects on the respondent's tendency to select a response category that is the same as the response category for the previous item. In some countries the proportion of explained variance due to differences between interviewers is larger than the proportion of variance explained by the differences between respondents.},

For this purpose, we focus on an interesting industry (political campaigns) and an intriguing empirical regularity (the tendency to ``go negative'' is higher in close races). We present a model of electoral competition in which ads inform voters either of the good traits of the candidate or of the bad traits of his opponent. We find that in equilibrium, the proportion of negative ads depends on both voters' knowledge and the candidate's budget. Furthermore, for an interesting subset of the parameter space, negativity increases in both knowledge and budget. Using data on the elections for the U. S. House of Representative in 2000, 2002, and 2004, we examine the model and its implications. Using nonstructural estimation, we find that negativity indeed increases in both voters' knowledge and the candidate's budget. Furthermore, we also find that knowledge and budget mediate the effect of closeness on negativity. Using structural estimation, we reinforce these findings. Specifically, we find that the model's parameters are within the subset of the parameter space discussed above. Thus, the evidence implies that the model is not only helpful in identifying variables that were ignored by previous studies (i.e., knowledge and budget) but also in explaining an intriguing empirical regularity.},

The present research remedies these problems and clarifies existing understandings of selection bias in news about murder in two important respects. Newsworthiness as represented by novelty is an incomplete explanation of selection bias. Instead, news about murder is the product of journalistic assessments of newsworthiness firmly grounded in long-standing race and gender typifications.},

Are these claims correct? Do voters, jurors, and legislators who lack political information make bad decisions? In The Democratic Dilemma, Professors Arthur Lupia and Mathew McCubbins explain how citizens make decisions about complex issues. Combining insights from economics, political science, and the cognitive sciences, they seek to develop theories and experiments about learning and choice. They use these tools to identify the requirements for reasoned choice - the choice that a citizen would make if she possessed a certain (perhaps, greater) level of knowledge. The results clarify debates about voter, juror, and legislator competence and also reveal how the design of political institutions affects citizens' abilities to govern themselves effectively.},

Such elitism is apparent in widely cited measures of ``political knowledge'' and in common claims about what voters should know. The elitist move typically limits the credibility and practical relevance of the analysis by leading writers to draw unreliable conclusions about voter competence. I propose a more constructive way of thinking about what voters know. Its chief virtue is its consistency with basic facts about the relationship between information and choice.},

The author concludes that risk discourse is often used to blame the victim, to displace the real reasons for ill-health upon the individual, and to express outrage at behavior deemed socially unacceptable, thereby exerting control over the body politic as well as the body corporeal. Risk discourse is redolent with the ideologies of mortality, danger, and divine retribution. Risk, as it is used in modern society, therefore cannot be considered a neutral term.},

  abstract = {Social scientists who use history as a laboratory for theory development use the work of historians to construct background narratives which can then be coded according to theoretically relevant categories. Yet, virtually no attention has been paid to how these historical monographs are to be chosen. On most periods and themes of interest available accounts differ, not only substantively but also with respect to the implicit theories and conceptual frameworks used to establish salience or produce commonsensical explanations. Unself-conscious use of historical monographs thus easily results in selection bias. Social scientists are bound to be more attracted to and convinced by accounts that accord with the expectations about events contained in the concepts they deploy and the theories they seek to test. Consideration of recent developments in historiographical theory supports the argument that responsible techniques for using historical sources are available, but they require understanding the extent to which patterns within historiography, rather than "History," must be the direct focus of investigation and explanation. Such an approach has the added advantage of helping to generate historically based studies where observations or cases outnumber variables.},

Beginning with the 1993 election, Canada's Progressive Conservative Party was replaced as the dominant force on the political right by the more ideological Reform Party/Canadian Alliance. This article examines what specific issues most centrally motivated this seismic shift among conservative Canadians. Method. Using data from the 1993, 1997, and 2000 Canadian Election Studies, we employ bivariate analyses and multinomial logit voting models to determine whether constitutional, economic, nativist, or moral issues most clearly differentiate PC supporters from R/A voters. Results. Regional concerns are important and other issues have sporadic impacts, but moral traditionalism is the most consistent and powerful factor distinguishing supporters of the new party from supporters of the old one. Conclusions. Although existing studies have focused primarily on other sources of R/A support, moral traditionalism is clearly a key factor in explaining the party's ascendancy. This phenomenon, we contend, is part of a larger trend toward postmaterial politics in Western democracies.},

In the search for a way out of this impasse, MacIntyre returns to an earlier strand of ethical thinking, that of Aristotle, who emphasised the importance of 'virtue' to the ethical life.  More than thirty years after its original publication, After Virtue remains a work that is impossible to ignore for anyone interested in our understanding of ethics and morality today.},

The authors describe a structural equations analysis of these four models, utilizing two data sets generated within a commercial pretest setting. The results suggest that a dual mediation hypothesis, which postulates that A\textsubscript{ad} influences brand attitude both directly and indirectly through its effect on brand cognitions, is superior to the other three models under the particular set of conditions in the pretest setting.},

A new theory, hierometer theory, predicts that it positively tracks social status. We tested both predictions with respect to two types of self-regard: self-esteem and narcissism. Study 1 (N = 940), featuring a cross-sectional design, found that both status and inclusion covaried positively with self-esteem, but that status alone covaried positively with narcissism. These links held independently of gender, age, and the Big Five personality traits. Study 2 (N = 627), a preregistered cross-sectional study, obtained similar results with alternative measures of self-esteem and narcissism. Studies 3--4 featured experimental designs in which status and inclusion were orthogonally manipulated. Study 3 (N = 104) found that both higher status and higher inclusion promoted higher self-esteem, whereas only higher status promoted higher narcissism. Study 4 (N = 259) obtained similar results with alternative measures of self-esteem and narcissism. The findings suggest that self-esteem operates as both sociometer and hierometer, positively tracking both status and inclusion, whereas narcissism operates primarily as a hierometer, positively tracking status.

According to this, Canada's social policy regime clearly belongs to the (mainly Anglo-American) `liberal' family, where markets and families retain a key role, supplemented by modest state supports. Yet, as some have recognized, there are important differences among liberal regimes and within a particular welfare regime over time. There are, in other words, `varieties of liberalism'. This article argues, moreover, that in the contemporary period Canadian welfare reform has been characterized by warring principles for redesign. While some have sought to deepen the postwar social project, the main trends have been neo-liberal restructuring and, more recently, policies inspired by `inclusive liberalism', though less deeply than under Blair's government in the UK. The continued existence of such alternatives suggests the need for a more nuanced conception of path-dependent change, consistent with recent revisionist trends in historical-institutionalism.},

These advantages can be maximized by paying careful attention to differences among presidential systems.

The author demonstrates, however, that most of Machiavelli's famous maxims are in fact derivative from ancient authors.

The author analyzes chapter 3 of The Prince to show that Machiavelli appropriates the decisive rhetorical strategy of many religious texts by appealing to an inevitable fear as the basis for his new moral outlook. If Machiavelli appropriates the methods he criticizes in others, then this article serves as an invitation to read both Machiavelli and classical thinkers with a renewed and genuine interest in the originality and realism of each.}

The authors also examine how the regime has at times failed to follow these principles, particularly with respect to Canada's Indigenous peoples in Canada, and how reforms to Canada's governing institutions challenge historical assumptions concerning parliamentary government and federalism.

Discussions of the Constitution, Charter, Senate reform, and judicial appointments are all updated, and new material is provided on the prorogation controversy, voter turnout, equalization payments, and prime ministerial government. The Canadian Regime continues to provide the most accessible introduction to the institutions, processes, and principles of the Canadian political system.},

This research note focuses on an issue that has not yet been studied: Are respondents who complete self-administered Web surveys more quickly---perhaps taking advantage of participation benefits while minimizing effort---also more prone to response order effects, a manifestation of ``satisficing''? I surveyed a random sample of the US adult population over the Web and manipulated the order in which respondents saw the response options. I then assessed whether primacy effects were moderated by the overall length of time respondents took to complete the questionnaires. I found that low-education respondents who filled out the questionnaire most quickly were most prone to primacy effects when completing items with unipolar rating scales. These results have important implications for various aspects of Web survey methodology including panel management, human--computer interaction, and response order randomization.},

While scholars have consistently shown cultural concerns to be strong predictors of opposition, findings regarding the labor-market competition hypothesis are highly contested. To help understand these divergent results, we distinguish between the prevalence and conditional impact of determinants of immigration attitudes. Leveraging a targeted sampling strategy of high-technology counties, we conduct a study of Americans' attitudes toward H-1B visas. The plurality of these visas are occupied by Indian immigrants, who are skilled but ethnically distinct, enabling us to measure a specific skill set (high technology) that is threatened by a particular type of immigrant (H-1B visa holders). Unlike recent aggregate studies, our targeted approach reveals that the conditional impact of the relationship in the high-technology sector between economic threat and immigration attitudes is sizable. However, labor-market competition is not a prevalent source of threat and therefore is generally not detected in aggregate analyses.},

Economists use a definition of public goods that rests on the inherent properties of the good itself. Referring to criteria such as non-rivalness and non-excludability, they assert that the distinction is fixed in nature and cannot be altered by human observes. We argue that the boundary between public and private goods is socially constructed. That is, what is a public good and what is a private good is not determined by fixed criteria; rather it is decided by society. Thus, what is a public good in one community might be a private good in another. It is this moveable boundary between public and private that makes it essential to analy?e public policy with values up front, not hidden behind the seemingly technical concept of public goods.},

  abstract = {Abstract:                 Most members of Parliament, as well as many Canadians, believe that the House of Commons should play a more direct role in policy making. This is particularly evident in the standing committee system, where MPS consider a successful committee to be one that has a direct influence on government policy. However, these policy-making expectations conflict with the reality of both the highly partisan Canadian House and the structure of the Westminster style of cabinet government and obscure the roles of scrutiny and education, which committees do perform effectively. Through a case study of the standing committee on finance and its 1989 investigation of the government's GST technical paper, we see that committee members tend to focus solely on policy making. By contrast, the government and many interest groups use the committee more as a public forum, often to communicate with each other. The real effect of committee members on policy-making is difficult to gauge and is intertwined with the committee's public-forum role. In an age of public disillusionment with Parliament and politicians, the gap between expectations and reality must be reconciled; however, this requires work on both sides. Governments and parties could relax their hold on committee members and actively seek out areas where committees can play a role in the policy-making process. In turn, committees must reconcile themselves to the reality of the Westminster system and be realistic in their policy-making expectations.                                                        Sommaire               La plupart des d{\'e}put{\'e}s ainsi que de nombreux Canadiens pensent que la Chambre des communes devrait jouer un r{\^o}le d{\'e}cisionnel plus direct dans la formulation des politiques. Ceci est particuli{\`e}rement {\'e}vident dans le cadre du syst{\`e}me des comit{\'e}s permanents, o{\'u} les d{\'e}put{\'e}s consid{\`e}rent que seuls les comit{\'e}s qui influent directement sur les politiques gouvernementales font du bon travail. Cependant, ces attentes en ce qui concerne la formulation des politiques se heurtent, d' aune part, {\`a} la r{\'e}alit{\'e} d'une Chambre des communes fortement divis{\'e}e et partisane et, d' autre part, {\`a} la structure gouvernementale style Westminster, ax{\'e}e sur le Conseil des ministres. Par ailleurs, ces arterites ignorent le travail d'analyse et d' {\'e}ducation qui est tres bien fait par les comit{\'e}s. Une {\'e}tude de cas du Comit{\'e} permanent des finances et de son enqu{\^e}te men{\'e}e en 1989 sur la pr{\'e}sentation technique du gouvernement concernant la TPS montre bien que les membr{\'e}s des comit{\'e}s ont tendance {\`a} se concentrer uniquement sur la formulation des politiques. Par contre, le gouvernement et de nombreux groupes \& d'int{\'e}r{\^e}t utilisent les comit{\'e}s en tant que forum public, souvent pour communiquer entre eux.

Media presentation of scientific evidence seems to involve the 'facts', which are then discussed and interpreted by various 'experts'. From an ethnomethodological or social constructionist perspective, however, news 'facts' themselves are socially constituted. Examining how health science is reported thus offers important insight into the social construction of health policy problems. We offer an interpretive account of United States newspaper coverage of passive smoking during a time in which several major scientific studies of the issue were conducted and reported upon. We argue that newspaper journalists, through the use of several rhetorical devices, constructed an account of the passive smoking issue in which scientific 'facts' were less important than moral 'facts'. Rather than (or sometimes, in addition to) explicating science, newspaper coverage conveyed a moral narrative highlighting tensions between American cultural values of individual liberty and protection of the public health.},

We recruit an American sample of (N = 454) liberals and conservatives to complete two rounds of an iterated prisoner's dilemma. Using a three-wave design, we obtain a sample of each ideological group that is comparable on multiple demographic factors. We hypothesize that a liberal orientation is underpinned by an approach-oriented social strategy that is directed towards pursuing cooperative opportunities, while a conservative orientation is underpinned by a social strategy directed towards avoiding loss. On multiple measures of ideology, we find evidence that liberals and conservatives differ in their: (1) initial cooperativeness; (2) overall cooperation; and, (3) forgiveness.},

Researchers have been divided into two groups---those who study leaders and those who study publics. The research programs have also been divided between those who use emotion to explain reliance on early experience that dominates contemporary judgment and those who use emotion to explain why people respond to the immediate contemporary circumstances around them. More recently, theory and research have attempted to reconcile these two seemingly contradictory roles by integrating them. Emotion's role in politics is pervasive both because emotion enables past experience to be encoded with its evaluative history and because emotion enables contemporary circumstances to be quickly evaluated. More recently still, theoretical models and supporting evidence suggest that there are multiple channels of emotional evaluations.},

However, details of its human hepatic metabolism have been speculative and incomplete, possibly due to the sensitivity of analytical techniques and selectivity of specific in vitro probes and reagents used. Studies with (R)-, (S)-, and racemic fluoxetine were undertaken to determine the stereospecific nature of its metabolism and estimate intrinsic clearance contributions of each CYP for fluoxetine N-demethylation. Measurable fluoxetine N-demethylase activity was catalyzed by CYP1A2, -2B6, -2C9, -2C19, -2D6, -3A4, and -3A5. All enzymes catalyzed this reaction for both enantiomers and the racemate, and intrinsic clearance values were similar for the enantiomers for all CYP enzymes except CYP2C9, which demonstrated stereoselectivity for R- over the S-enantiomer. Scaling the intrinsic clearance values for the individual CYP enzymes to estimate contributions of each in human liver microsomes suggested that CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 contribute the greatest amount of fluoxetine N-demethylation in human liver microsomes. These data were corroborated with the examination of the effects of CYP-specific inhibitors quinidine (CYP2D6), sulfaphenazole (CYP2C9), and ketoconazole (CYP3A4) on fluoxetine N-demethylation in pooled human liver microsomes. Together, these findings suggest a significant role for the polymorphically expressed CYP2D6 in fluoxetine clearance and are consistent with reports on the clinical pharmacokinetics of fluoxetine.},

  abstract = {Developmental exposure to estrogenic chemicals induces morphological, functional, and behavioral anomalies associated with reproduction. Humans are routinely exposed to bisphenol-A (BPA), an estrogenic compound that leaches from dental materials and plastic food and beverage containers. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of in utero exposure to low, environmentally relevant doses of BPA on the development of female reproductive tissues in CD-1 mice. In previous publications, we have shown that this treatment alters the morphology of the mammary gland and affects estrous cyclicity. Here we report that in utero exposure to 25 and 250 ng BPA/ kg of body weight per day via osmotic pumps implanted into pregnant dams at Gestational Day 9 induces alterations in the genital tract of female offspring that are revealed during adulthood. They include decreased wet weight of the vagina, decreased volume of the endometrial lamina propria, increased incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine into the DNA of endometrial gland epithelial cells, and increased expression of estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha) and progesterone receptor in the luminal epithelium of the endometrium and subepithelial stroma. Because ERalpha is known to be expressed in these estrogen-target organs at the time of BPA exposure, it is plausible that BPA may directly affect the expression of ER-controlled genes involved in the morphogenesis of these organs. In addition, BPA-induced alterations that specifically affect hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis function may further contribute to the anomalies observed at 3 mo of age, long after the cessation of BPA exposure.},

Are these strategies making politicians and governments more responsive to voters' needs, or do they pose a threat to democracy?

Through dynamic case studies that range from the resurrection of the Conservative Party, to media accounts of political marketing, to Tim Hortons as a political brand, the authors trace how political marketing is transforming the old system of brokerage politics into a new, distinctly Canadian model. Citizens are now viewed as consumers, and platforms and promises have been repackaged as products. Whether this trend is positive or negative, the authors argue, depends on how politicians and governments carry out political marketing - and its promises - in practice.},

Here, our intention is to stimulate discussion and, as with any heuristic, this one will stand or fall depending on whether other researchers find it useful. Secondly, we critically examine the relationship between political marketing/branding and governance and democracy. Here, we argue strongly that it is essential to develop a more critical political marketing/branding agenda. This research agenda would be much less instrumental in its research concerns and draw on broader epistemological and theoretical perspectives, allowing it to interrogate the relationship between marketing/branding and democracy in more depth than is the case at present.},

  abstract = {This study examines how unique audience segments within the Canadian population think and act toward climate change, and explores whether and how the level of audience engagement moderates the effect of various messages on support for climate policy. Drawing on a random probability sample of Canadian residents (N = 1207) conducted in October 2017, we first identify and describe five distinct audiences that vary in their attitudes, perceptions and behaviours with respect to climate change: the Alarmed (25\%), Concerned (45\%), Disengaged (5\%), Doubtful (17\%) and Dismissive (8\%). We then explore how each segment responds to different messages about carbon pricing in Canada. We find that messages alluding to earmarking (i.e., ``Invest in solutions'') or leveling the playing field for alternative energy sources (i.e., ``Relative price'') increase support for a higher carbon price among the population as a whole. However, these messages decreased support for carbon pricing among more engaged audiences (e.g., Alarmed) when a low carbon price was specified to the respondent. Meanwhile, the ``Relative price'' is the only message that increased policy support among less engaged audiences--the Concerned and the Doubtful. In addition to highlighting the importance of tailoring and targeting messages for differently engaged segments, these results suggest that communicating around the specific consequences of carbon taxes for the prices of some goods may be a fruitful way to enhance support for carbon taxes among relatively less engaged audiences.},

First, I use address history data to identify 52,000 residents of new multifamily buildings in large cities, their previous address, the current residents of those addresses, and so on for six rounds. The sequence quickly reaches units in below-median income neighborhoods, which account for nearly 40 percent of the sixth round, and similar patterns appear for neighborhoods in the bottom quintile of income or percent white. Next, I use a simple simulation model to roughly quantify these migratory connections under a range of assumptions. Constructing a new market-rate building that houses 100 people ultimately leads 45 to 70 people to move out of below-median income neighborhoods, with most of the effect occurring within three years. These results suggest that the migration ripple effects of new housing will affect a wide spectrum of neighborhoods and loosen the low-income housing market.},

The term "social mechanisms" should be used to refer to recurrent processes generating a specific kind of outcome. Explanation of social macro-phenomena by mechanisms typically involves causal regression to lower-level elements, as stipulated by methodological individualism. While there exist a good many mechanism models to explain emergent effects of collective behavior, we lack a similarly systematic treatment of generative mechanisms in which institutions and specific kinds of structural configurations play the decisive role.},

However, the very fact it becomes difficult to replicate effects when features of the tests are tied down actually serves to vindicate statistical significance tests. While statistical significance tests, used correctly, serve to bound the probabilities of erroneous interpretations of data, this error control is nullified by data-dredging, multiple testing, and other biasing selection effects. Arguments claiming to vitiate statistical significance tests attack straw person variants of tests that commit well-known fallacies and misinterpretations. There is a tension between popular calls for preregistration -- arguably, one of the most promising ways to boost replication -- and accounts that downplay error probabilities: Bayes Factors, Bayesian posteriors, likelihood ratios. By underscoring the importance of error control for well testedness, the replication crisis points to reformulating tests so as to avoid fallacies and report the extent of discrepancies that are and are not indicated with severity.},

The initiative's failure is ascribed to a misreading of government intentions and to an inconsistency between proposals for national corporatism and other, noncorporatist, features of the existing collective bargaining system. Emphasis is placed on the state's role, past and present, in shaping interest group behaviour and in establishing or vetoing corporatism. /// Dans cet article l'auteur examine l'initiative corporatiste avort{\'e}e du Cong{\'e}s du Travail du Canada de 1976-1978.

Using deeds records and voter rolls, we show that current residents are more likely to sell their homes when opposite-party neighbors move in nearby than when unaffiliated or same-party neighbors do. This is especially true when the new neighbors are politically active, consistent with an animosity between parties mechanism. We conclude that affective polarization is not limited to purely political settings and affects one of the household's most important financial decisions, their home~transactions.}

Those changes brought the party closer to governing than ever before but ultimately not into power. McGrane then poses a difficult question: Was remaking the NDP message and revitalizing its campaign model the right choice after all, considering it fell to its perennial third-party spot in 2015? The New NDP examines Canada's NDP at a pivotal time in its history and provides lessons for progressive parties on how to win elections in the age of the internet, big data, and social media.},

Using data from the Toronto Election Study, a large-N survey of electors conducted around the time of the 2014 Toronto Election, this study identifies a series of factors related to roll-off from mayoral to council elections. These variables include a number of sociodemographic characteristics and attitudinal factors commonly associated with turnout, measures of attachment to the city, and a series of election-specific factors. Results reveal that many factors commonly associated with abstention similarly drive roll-off, but that the experiences of individual voters also have an impact upon roll-off rates.},

This situation arises from market forces that react to, and take advantage of, the unique characteristics of academic libraries and scholarly publishing. These characteristics include the unique role of academic libraries, in their mission of serving as accessible repositories of knowledge, and the unique activity of scholarly publishing, in which every journal title is unique without a close substitute. The combination of these of factors leads to the lowest price elasticity of demand for the libraries and the highest degree of product differentiation for each journal title. While some solutions being offered to alter the dilemma hold promise, the unique characteristics of the market appear to discourage more equitable pricing without a radical restructuring of the industry or of the relationships between the consumers and the producers of academic journals.},

  abstract = {Background Cessation of community water fluoridation (CWF) appears to be occurring with increasing frequency in some regions. Our objective was to comprehensively review published research on the impact of CWF cessation on dental caries. Methods We searched 13 multidisciplinary databases. Results were synthesised qualitatively and quantitatively. Results We identified 15 instances of CWF cessation (`intervention') in 13 countries, which covered a broad time frame (1956--2003) and diverse geographical and political/economic contexts. Overall, results were mixed, but pointed more to an increase in caries postcessation than otherwise. For example, of the 9 studies with at least moderate methodological quality based on criteria we developed for this review, 5 showed an increase in caries postcessation. 3 studies did not show an increase in caries postcessation; however, important postcessation changes (eg, implementation of alternative fluoride delivery programmes) and/or large-scale social change may have contributed to those effects. Of the 3 study groupings that permitted quantitative synthesis, 2 showed statistically significant mean overall increase in caries postcessation; however, quantitative synthesis results must be interpreted cautiously. Conclusions Overall, the published research points more to an increase in dental caries post-CWF cessation than otherwise. However, the literature is highly diverse and variable in methodological quality. To build this literature, it is important to exploit research opportunities presented by CWF cessation. Remaining knowledge gaps include the impact of CWF cessation on the distribution of dental caries (ie, equitable or not) and understanding the decision-making circumstances around CWF cessation.},

  abstract = {Objectives We examined the effect of fluoridation cessation on children's dental caries experience in the Canadian cities of Calgary (cessation in 2011) and Edmonton (still fluoridated). Methods We used a pre-post cross-sectional design with comparison group. We studied Grade 2 schoolchildren (approximately 7 years old) 7-8 years after fluoridation cessation in Calgary, thus capturing children born after cessation occurred. Data collection included a dental examination conducted in school by calibrated dental hygienists, a questionnaire completed by parents, and fingernail clippings for a small subsample. Our overall analytic approach was twofold. We first examined differences in dental caries experience (deft and DMFT, and smooth surface caries based on defs and DMFS) between Calgary and Edmonton and over time (comparing 2018/2019 data to pre-cessation and early post-cessation surveys in our setting). Second, we evaluated whether differences were likely to reflect fluoridation cessation in Calgary, rather than other factors. Results The prevalence of caries in the primary dentition was significantly higher (P {$<$} .05) in Calgary (fluoridation cessation) than in Edmonton (still fluoridated). For example, crude deft prevalence in 2018/2019 was 64.8\% (95\% CI 62.3-67.3), n = 2649 in Calgary and 55.1\% (95\% CI 52.3-57.8), n = 2600 in Edmonton. These differences were consistent and robust: they persisted with adjustment for potential confounders and in the subset of respondents who were lifelong residents and reported usually drinking tap water; they had widened over time since cessation; and they were corroborated by assessments of dental fluorosis and estimates of total fluoride intake from fingernail clippings. Findings for permanent teeth were less consistent, which likely reflects that 7-year-olds have not had the time to accumulate enough permanent dentition caries experience for differences to have become apparent. Conclusions Our findings are consistent with an adverse impact of fluoridation cessation on children's dental health in Calgary and point to the need for universal, publicly funded prevention activities---including but not limited to fluoridation.},

Depuis 2005, les liens entre l'ensemble des groupes de r{\'e}flexion conservateurs, financ{\'e}s par des donateurs priv{\'e}s, sont devenus plus serr{\'e}s.

The relationships between think tanks and their funders are central to theory and public discourse about the politics of policy knowledge, yet very little research systematically examines these relationships across cases. This article evaluates elite, pluralist, and field theories by analyzing original data on funding and politics for 30 think tanks from 2000 to 2011 with comparative and relational methods. I find that foreign donations help support some conservative think tanks, but that it is a small amount of money relative to other funding sources. Domestically, think tank funding is structured by an opposition between donor-funded conservatives and state-funded centrists. Since 2005, the cluster of conservative think tanks funded by private donors has become tighter, while the cluster of think tanks supported by the state has become looser and more reliant on self-generated revenue and interest and investments. These findings cast doubt on predictions derived from elite and pluralist theories, and offer some support for field theory.},

It explores the often ambivalent role a revised, more nuanced notion of objectivity plays in the legitimation of the proliferating journalisms and quasi-journalisms---what I will refer to collectively as the cultural form of factuality---now competing for users, market share and revenue on the internet.

  abstract = {Quebec in this century has undergone changes that have had a profound impact in Quebec and on Canada as a whole. Initially, the political response to Quebec's urbanization and industrialization was delayed, thanks to the persistence in power of Maurice Duplessis's Union nationale. The Quebec state expanded rapidly to assume functions held by the Church and to carve out a new role for Francophones in the Quebec economy. Traditional French-Canadian nationalism was replaced by a secular, Quebec-based nationalism. Out of these processes emerged a challenge to the Canadian political order: the Quebec independence movement.In the newly written concluding chapter to this definite study of Quebec politics and society, Kenneth McRoberts examines recent events and attitudes. The failed Meech Lake Accord, the rejection of the Charlottetown Accord by Quebec and by the rest of Canada, the emergence of the Bloc qu{\'e}b{\'e}cois in the House of Commons, the strong yet vacillating support for sovereignty in Quebec, the constitutional exhaustion of the Canadian body politic, the polarization of Canada's two solitudes, and North American economic integration all point to an uncertain future for Quebec - and for Canada.},

Political and social polarization are group-based phenomena characterized by intergroup heterogeneity and intragroup homogeneity, but existing measures capture only one of these features or make it difficult to compare across cases or over time. To bring the concept and measurement of polarization into closer alignment, I introduce the cluster-polarization coefficient (CPC), a measure of multimodality that allows scholars to incorporate multiple variables and compare across contexts with varying numbers of parties or social groups. Three applications to elite and mass polarization demonstrate that the CPC returns substantively sensible results, and an open-source software package implements the measure.},

  abstract = {In the research integrity literature, funding plays two different roles: it is thought to elevate questionable research practices (QRPs) due to perverse incentives, and it is a potential actor to incentivize research integrity standards. Recent studies, asking funders, have emphasized the importance of the latter. However, the perspective of active researchers on the impact of competitive research funding on science has not been explored yet. Here, I address this issue by conducting a series of group sessions with researchers in two different countries with different degrees of competition for funding, from three scientific fields (medical sciences, natural sciences, humanities), and in two different career stages (permanent versus temporary employment). Researchers across all groups experienced that competition for funding shapes science, with many unintended negative consequences. Intriguingly, these consequences had little to do with the type of QRPs typically being presented in the research integrity literature. Instead, the researchers pointed out that funding could result in predictable, fashionable, short-sighted, and overpromising science. This was seen as highly problematic: scientists experienced that the `projectification' of science makes it more and more difficult to do any science of real importance: plunging into the unknown or addressing big issues that need a long-term horizon to mature. They also problematized unintended negative effects from collaboration and strategizing. I suggest it may be time to move away from a focus on QRPs in connection with funding, and rather address the real problems. Such a shift may then call for entirely different types of policy actions.},

Here we review and discuss differences between humans and non-humans in the strategies employed to maintain cooperation and control free-riders. We distinguish forms of cooperative behaviour based on their influence on the immediate payoffs of actor and recipient. If the actor has immediate costs and only the recipient obtains immediate benefits, we term this investment. If the behaviour has immediate positive effects for both actor and recipient, we call this a self-serving mutually beneficial behaviour or mutual cooperation. We argue that humans, in contrast to all other species, employ a wider range of enforcement mechanisms, which allow higher levels of cooperation to evolve and stabilize among unrelated individuals and in large groups. We also discuss proximate mechanisms underlying cooperative behaviour and focus on our experimental work with humans and our closest primate relatives. Differences in the proximate mechanisms also seem to contribute to explaining humans' greater ability to cooperate and enforce cooperation.},

However, this is not a sufficient explanation for less salient and politically charged questions. More attention needs to be given to antiintellectualism---the generalized mistrust of intellectuals and experts. Using data from the General Social Survey and a survey of 3,600 Americans on Amazon Mechanical Turk, I provide evidence of a strong association between anti-intellectualism and opposition to scientific positions on climate change, nuclear power, GMOs, and water fluoridation, particularly for respondents with higher levels of political interest. Second, a survey experiment shows that anti-intellectualism moderates the acceptance of expert consensus cues such that respondents with high levels of anti-intellectualism actually increase their opposition to these positions in response. Third, evidence shows anti-intellectualism is connected to populism, a worldview that sees political conflict as primarily between ordinary citizens and a privileged societal elite. Exposure to randomly assigned populist rhetoric, even that which does not pertain to experts directly, primes anti-intellectual predispositions among respondents in the processing of expert consensus cues. These findings suggest that rising anti-elite rhetoric may make anti-intellectual sentiment more salient in information processing.},

Canadians are, however, becoming modestly more ideologically consistent and much more sorted---that is, partisanship, ideological identification, and policy beliefs are increasingly interconnected.

Avoiding elite and public polarization is thus essential for an effective societal response to the pandemic. In the United States, there appears to be elite and public polarization on the severity of the pandemic (Gadarian et al., 2020). Other evidence suggests that polarization is undermining compliance with social distancing (Cornelson and Miloucheva, 2020).

We examine survey measures of two of those worldviews--egalitarianism and individualism--to understand their relationship with belief systems. Contrary to what one might expect based on the cultural theory literature, we find that people with low levels of political knowledge seem not to have coherent worldviews regarding these issues. In contrast, people with high levels of political knowledge respond to egalitarianism and individualism questions as if they were opposite ends of a single, liberal-conservative continuum, rather than two of four distinct worldviews. We conclude that cultural theory researchers should take account of the influence of political knowledge whenever they investigate worldviews.}

  abstract = {In the analysis of causal effects in non-experimental studies, conditioning on observable covariates is one way to try to reduce unobserved confounder bias. However, a developing literature has shown that conditioning on certain covariates may increase bias, and the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon have not been fully explored. We add to the literature on bias-increasing covariates by first introducing a way to decompose omitted variable bias into three constituent parts: bias due to an unobserved confounder, bias due to excluding observed covariates, and bias due to amplification. This leads to two important findings. Although instruments have been the primary focus of the bias amplification literature to date, we identify the fact that the popular approach of adding group fixed effects can lead to bias amplification as well. This is an important finding because many practitioners think that fixed effects are a convenient way to account for any and all group-level confounding and are at worst harmless. The second finding introduces the concept of bias unmasking and shows how it can be even more insidious than bias amplification in some cases. After introducing these new results analytically, we use constructed observational placebo studies to illustrate bias amplification and bias unmasking with real data. Finally, we propose a way to add bias decomposition information to graphical displays for sensitivity analysis to help practitioners think through the potential for bias amplification and bias unmasking in actual applications.},

  abstract = {Constitutional interpretation in Canada is dominated by the metaphor of the ``living tree''. Living tree constitutional interpretation is usually defined in terms of its incompatibility with what is understood in Canada to be the central commitment of originalist interpretation: that the constitution is, in some sense, ``frozen at the moment of adoption. But the tenets of originalism that are used as a definitional contrast are not widely held by originalist constitutional scholars today, and are in fact expressly rejected in the new originalist theories that have been developed principally (but not exclusively) in the United States over the past 20 years. There has not been a meaningful engagement in Canada with contemporary schools of originalist interpretation. The originalism rejected by the Supreme Court of Canada in 1985 (and periodically reaffirmed thereafter), is not the new originalism, and a rejection of this new family of interpretive theories does not necessarily follow from the fact of the Supreme Court of Canada's rejection of original intent originalism. Unfortunately, the Canadian courts have continued to affirm living tree constitutional doctrine and denounce originalism without providing much of an account of what they are accepting or rejecting.  This paper is a prefatory study to an engagement with new originalist scholarship. I attempt a statement of the current commitments in Canadian living constitutional doctrine (pausing to engage with theoretical arguments that have been made in its defence) and, in passing, note the Supreme Court's attitudes towards originalism. My purpose is to determine what the central commitments of living tree constitutional doctrine are, as a preliminary step towards a later study to determine the extent to which Canadian doctrine is truly incompatible with orginalist interpretation. I explore what I observe to be the four central commitments to living tree constitutionalism in Canada: (1) the doctrine of progressive interpretation; (2) the use of a purposive methodology in progressive interpretation; (3) the absence of any necessary role for the original intent or meaning of framers in interpreting the constitution; and (4) the presence of other constraints on judicial interpretation.},

This is a longstanding empirical debate in immigration opinion research and a debate that has struggled to distinguish the relative effects. I help settle this debate with a battery of analyses on attitudes toward immigration across the American National Election Studies and Voter Study Group data, spanning analyses on immigration opinion for white Americans from 1992 to 2017 at levels as granular as the state, county, core-based statistical area (CBSA), and the ZIP code. My analyses are unequivocal that ethnocentrism is reliably the largest and most precise predictor of attitudes toward immigration. Further analyses and simulations from models most consistent with the economic anxiety argument show that a standard deviation increase in ethnocentrism is still a greater or equal magnitude effect than all economic anxiety proxies combined. I close with implications for immigration opinion research.},

Indeed, critics have often seen emotion as a potentially dangerous force that can sway the unsophisticated masses to undesirable ends. This article challenges the view that emotion is an outgrowth of low sophistication, arguing that high sophisticates are more likely to experience emotion in reaction to politics and that emotions are more influential on the political behavior of high sophisticates. Drawing upon appraisal theory, this article develops a theory of how political engagement elicits emotionality about politics, and how emotion interacts with understanding and motivation to produce its greatest impact on the behavior of those citizens who are the most politically sophisticated. Behavioral effects are examined in the contexts of presidential voting behavior and Iraq War policy attitudes. Hypotheses are tested on pooled American National Election Studies (ANES) data and an original web-based survey of undergraduates.},

Neglected areas such as the role of secrecy, public relations and the mass media in the science-policy interface are brought into sharper focus as an intrinsic part of the wider operation of definitional struggles. The focus on definitional struggles also sheds light on some current work on risk in social theory. It is argued that the neglect of questions of agency which are central to definitional struggles has led to some theorists presenting risks as inevitable concomitants of technological and cultural developments leaving them in the grip of political quietism.

  abstract = {Objective Crowding-out effects of tobacco consumption refers to the situation in which tobacco consumption reduces a household's spending on other commodities. In this paper, we test for the crowding-out effects of recreational tobacco consumption on food expenditures among on-reserve Indigenous communities in Canada. Methods We use data from household expenditure surveys (N=469) to investigate tobacco consumption behaviour of on-reserve households of six First Nation communities in Canada. Using conditional Engel curves, we estimate the crowding-out effects of spending on tobacco on budget share of other expenditure categories with a focus on food expenditures. Results Our analysis showed that crowding-out effects of consuming tobacco on consumption of goods and services are minimal with an estimated impact of -0.00004 on the budget share of food expenditures in the remaining budget excess of expenditures on tobacco. While crowding-out effects are not statistically significant in general, the budget share of store-bought food expenditures is significantly lower (i.e. 5\%) among tobacco consumer households. Conclusion This study sheds new light on some of the indirect impacts of recreational tobacco use and Indigenous food insecurity in Canada. This study is the first attempt to test for crowding-out effects of tobacco consumption among Indigenous populations in Canada. Our findings are important and highlight areas for substantial improvements in health and well-being outcomes given the alarming rates of food insecurity experienced by Indigenous communities in Canada.},

  abstract = {With the growing possibilities for conducting web surveys, researchers increasingly use such surveys to recruit student samples for research purposes in a wide array of social science disciplines. Simultaneously, higher education students are recurrently asked to complete course and teacher evaluations online and to participate in small-scale research projects of fellow students, potentially leading to survey fatigue among student populations across the globe. One of the most frequently reported effects of over-surveying is a decrease in overall response rates. This situation has significant impacts on the generalizability and external validity of findings based on web surveys. The collection of reliable data is, nevertheless, crucial for researchers as well as educational practitioners and administrators, and strategies should be developed for achieving acceptable response rates. This paper reports on a methodological experiment (N = 15,651) conducted at the University of Antwerp, Belgium, in which possible strategies to improve survey response are explored. I specifically focus on the impact of an extra reminder as well as specific reminder contents on response rates. The results reveal that extra reminders are effective for increasing response rates, but not for diversifying the sample.},

However, scholars often unwittingly distort treatment effect estimates by conditioning on variables that could be affected by their experimental manipulation. Typical examples include controlling for posttreatment variables in statistical models, eliminating observations based on posttreatment criteria, or subsetting the data based on posttreatment variables. Though these modeling choices are intended to address common problems encountered when conducting experiments, they can bias estimates of causal effects. Moreover, problems associated with conditioning on posttreatment variables remain largely unrecognized in the field, which we show frequently publishes experimental studies using these practices in our discipline's most prestigious journals. We demonstrate the severity of experimental posttreatment bias analytically and document the magnitude of the potential distortions it induces using visualizations and reanalyses of real-world data. We conclude by providing applied researchers with recommendations for best practice.},

Using these data, we performed OLS and tobit estimations to identify factors influencing citation frequency. Results. The regressions show that the reputation of the journal in which the article is published, though important, does not explain everything. The gender of the author(s), the number of authors, the geographical focus of the article, the field, and the methodology also matter. Conclusion. An article is more likely to be widely cited if it is published in a prestigious journal, if it is written by several authors, if it applies quantitative methods, if it compares countries, and if it deals with administration and public policy or elections and political parties. Faculty members who belong to larger departments and those who are women are more cited.},

  abstract = {The rhetoric of ``excellence'' is pervasive across the academy. It is used to refer to research outputs as well as researchers, theory and education, individuals and organizations, from art history to zoology. But does ``excellence'' actually mean anything? Does this pervasive narrative of ``excellence'' do any good? Drawing on a range of sources we interrogate ``excellence'' as a concept and find that it has no intrinsic meaning in academia. Rather it functions as a linguistic interchange mechanism. To investigate whether this linguistic function is useful we examine how the rhetoric of excellence combines with narratives of scarcity and competition to show that the hyper-competition that arises from the performance of ``excellence'' is completely at odds with the qualities of good research. We trace the roots of issues in reproducibility, fraud, and homophily to this rhetoric. But we also show that this rhetoric is an internal, and not primarily an external, imposition. We conclude by proposing an alternative rhetoric based on soundness and capacity-building. In the final analysis, it turns out that that ``excellence'' is not excellent. Used in its current unqualified form it is a pernicious and dangerous rhetoric that undermines the very foundations of good research and scholarship.

During the campaign, the NDP associate president for Quebec, Michel Agnaieff, and six other NDP candidates took a controversial stand on minority-language rights. Katz said Broadbent's reaction showed how the federal leader said one thing to francophones and another to anglophones.              Lauraine Vaillancourt, the NDP candidate in Terrebonne and vice-president of the Quebec Federation of Labor, said she supported Broadbent's leadership.},

However, there is limited research on the effect incumbency has on voters' engagement with election campaigns. This paper examines whether the use of incumbency as a cue when voting is associated with there being less interest in an election and whether campaign period attentiveness affects incumbent support. We consider these questions using data from the Toronto Election Study, a large-N, two-wave survey of Torontonians conducted around the time of the 2014 Toronto Municipal Election. We find that attentiveness, on its own, does not make voters more likely to support an incumbent or non-incumbent candidate. However, among individuals with high knowledge, attentiveness decreases the likelihood of supporting the incumbent, as opposed to a non-incumbent candidate.},

This paper critically examines the implications of this account from the perspective of Formalism: a narratological approach to critique that focuses on how narratives are made compelling, and hence powerful. Compelling narratives deploy devices that establish (i) credibility and (ii) defamiliarization. Using this approach the paper identifies and examines different ideological strands in the nascent literature on evidence based management: pragmatism, progress, systematization, technique, accumulation. These are the means by which advocates of evidence based approaches construct a compelling story about the value of this approach. Prior criticism of the evidence based approach has centred on epistemological and technical issues. The aim here is to use an aesthetic mode of criticism to highlight political and moral implications. These are important given the relationship between claims to knowledge and the use of power; and the interaction between management research, and management as practice.},

  abstract = {This article assesses the impact of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms on the Canadian political system. Unlike some commentators who have minimized the effect of the Charter, the author finds that the Charter is inducing significant and permanent changes in the conduct of Canadian politics. Canadian judges have shed their pre-Charter style of deference and self-restraint, and are playing a bolder and more influential role in the governing process. Charter decisions are remolding the Canadian criminal law process along the lines of the "due process" model and away from the "crime control" model of the pre-Charter era. The Charter has also begun to change the way the Canadian political system operates. Interest groups have responded by making greater use of Charter constitutional litigation as a tactic to pursue policy objectives. Law-making areas once solely the prerogative of provincial governments are now being threatened with uniform national standards laid down by the Supreme Court in the course of Charter decisions. Political executives are using the reference procedure to pass Charter issues on to the courts in order to avoid dealing with political "hot potatoes" such as abortion and minority language education. In sum, the predicted "judicialization of politics" is well under way. /// Cet article {\'e}value l'impact de la Charte des droits et libert{\'e}s sur le syst{\`e}me politique canadien. Contrairement {\`a} plusieurs commentateurs qui ont minimis{\'e} le r{\^o}le de la Charte, l'auteur estime que cette derni{\`e}re est en voie d'introduire des changements importants et significatifs dans la conduite de la politique canadienne. Les juges canadiens ont abandonn{\'e} leur d{\'e}f{\'e}rence et leur retenue d'avant la promulgation de la Charte, jouant maintenant un r{\^o}le plus audacieux et plus influent dans les processus gouvernementaux. Les jugements relatifs {\`a} la Charte sont en train de remodeler le droit criminel canadien dans le sens du mod{\`e}le dit du {$<<$} due process {$>>$}, s'{\'e}loignant ainsi de celui ayant pr{\'e}valu jusqu'alors, le contr{\^o}le de la criminalit{\'e}. La Charte a aussi commenc{\'e} {\`a} changer les modalit{\'e}s d'op{\'e}ration du syst{\`e}me politique canadien. Les groupes d'int{\'e}r{\^e}t ont r{\'e}agi en utilisant davantage la r{\'e}f{\'e}rence constitutionnelle {\`a} la Charte, comme tactique dans la logique de leurs objectifs politiques. Les domaines l{\'e}gislatifs auparavant r{\'e}serv{\'e}s aux provinces sont maintemant menac{\'e}s par des crit{\`e}res nationaux uniformes impos{\'e}s par la Cour supr{\^e}me dans ses jugements portant sur la Charte. Les gouvernants se servent de la proc{\'e}dure de r{\'e}f{\'e}rence pour renvoyer au pouvoir judiciaire des questions relatives {\`a} la Charte, {\'e}vitant ainsi de faire face {\`a} des questions d{\'e}licates telles l'avortement et le financement de l'{\'e}ducation dans la langue des minorit{\'e}s.

  abstract = {Nearly a century ago, Frank Knight famously distinguished between risk and uncertainty with respect to the nature of decisions made in a business enterprise. He associated generating economic profit with making entrepreneurial decisions in the face of fundamental uncertainties. This uncertainty is complex because it cannot be reliably hedged unless it is reducible to risk. In making sense of uncertainty, the mathematics of probability that is used for risk calculations may lose relevance. Fast-and-frugal heuristics, on the other hand, provide robust strategies that can perform well under uncertainty. The present paper describes the structure and nature of such heuristics and provides conditions under which each class of heuristics performs successfully. Dealing with uncertainty requires knowledge but not necessarily an exhaustive use of information. In many business situations, effective heuristic decision-making deliberately ignores information and hence uses fewer resources. In an uncertain world, less often proves to be more.},

Objectivity is a contested value and the lines are often hard to draw between fact, spin and misrepresentation. Public servants are held to higher standards of objectivity than politicians, a fact on which politicians trade when they seek to attribute assessments of evidence to their officials. The growing openness of government documentation is placing pressure on departmental officials who wish to be both loyal to their political masters and honest in their factual assessments. These issues are discussed with reference to recent Australian experience (and also with reference to the UK Hutton Inquiry into the death of Dr David Kelly.

The text develops a theoretical model of media performance which it then compares across numerous democratic states leading to the identification of varying patterns of media performance. The study also reveals important links between media performance and various aspects of a well-functioning democratic regime.--},

It has been widely claimed that this partisan social divide extends to Americans' decisions about where to live. In two original survey experiments, we confirm that Democrats are, in fact, more likely than Republicans to prefer living in more Democratic, dense, and racially diverse places. However, improving on previous studies, we test respondents' stated preferences against their actual moving behavior. While partisans differ in their residential preferences, on average they are not migrating to more politically distinct communities. Using zip-code-level census and partisanship data on the places where respondents live, we provide one explanation for this contradiction: by prioritizing common concerns when deciding where to live, Americans forgo the opportunity to move to more politically compatible communities.},

I show how an understanding of Xenophon's analysis of virtue within both republican and imperial political orders can lead to a fruitful confrontation with the thought of his most famous student, admirer, and antagonist, Machiavelli.},

We used this assay to predict low dose activity of two xenoestrogens in mice. In serum-free medium, bisphenol A, a component of polycarbonates and of resins used to line metal food cans, showed a lower relative binding affinity (RBA; 0.006\%) than octylphenol (0.072\%) and nonylphenol (0.026\%), which are used as surfactants in many commercial products (all RBAs are relative to estradiol, which is equal to 100\%). In 100\% serum from adult men, bisphenol A showed a higher RBA (0.01\%) than in serum-free medium and thus enhanced access to estrogen receptors relative to estradiol. In contrast, octylphenol showed a 22-fold decrease in RBA (0.0029\%) and nonylphenol showed a 5-fold decrease in RBA (0.0039\%) when measured in adult serum. This indicates that, relative to estradiol, serum had less of an inhibitory effect on the cell uptake and binding in MCF-7 cells of bisphenol A, while serum had a greater inhibitory effect on octylphenol and nonylphenol relative to estradiol. Extrapolation of these relative activities in adult serum predicted that the estrogenic bioactivity of bisphenol A would be over 500-fold greater than that of octylphenol in fetal mouse serum. Bisphenol A and octylphenol were fed to pregnant mice at 2 and 20 micrograms/kg/day. Exposure of male mouse fetuses to either dose of bisphenol A, but to neither dose of octylphenol, significantly increased their adult prostate weight relative to control males, which is consistent with the higher predicted bioactivity of bisphenol A than octylphenol in the RBA-SMA assay. In addition, our findings show for the first time that fetal exposure to environmentally relevant parts-per-billion (ppb) doses of bisphenol A, in the range currently being consumed by people, can alter the adult reproductive system in mice.},

The Survey of Social Engagement in Canada, a large survey of Canadians conducted by Statistics Canada in 2003, is used in order to test the role of social relations and connections in accounting for political participation. Analyses show that although the ``usual suspects'' play important roles in explaining political activities, the main culprit is social capital. Among social capital measures, though all are important, associational involvement and social networks, followed by trust and volunteering, are the best predictors of political participation. Moreover, the effect of social capital varies by period of immigration. Theoretical and policy implications of findings are discussed.R{\'e}sum{\'e}.

Consider also the numerous comments and posts on Internet blogs, Twitter, and Facebook that illustrate the confusion between opinion and factual data. How do we learn to interpret the research we hear about and read, to distinguish opinions from scientific facts, and to use this knowledge to conduct our own studies to answer the questions faced in everyday situations? Understanding the components that go into scientific research and learning how to do research, make decisions about which statistics to use, and analyze statistical findings are goals for everyone in today's research-oriented world. Questions about the reliability and validity of data from a study or public opinion poll come up routinely and need critical review. This book contributes to achieving these objectives.  Doing Survey Research is intended for people who want to learn how to conduct quantitative studies for a project in an undergraduate course, a graduate-level thesis, or a survey that an employer may want completed. This brief, practical textbook prepares beginners to conduct their own survey research and write up the results, as well as read and interpret other people's research. It combines survey design with data analysis and interpretation. And it is for those who need to understand and critically interpret survey research found in scholarly journals, reports distributed in the workplace, and social scientific findings presented online in the media, on a blog, or in social media postings. Essential new updates to this edition include coverage of Big Data, Meta-Analysis, and A/B testing methodology---methods used by scholars as well as~businesses like Netflix and Amazon. New to this Fourth Edition  Each chapter and its exercises feature updated data and illustrations from current academic and popular articles relevant to today's web-oriented students, including studies focused on topics related to social media. Update web site https://doingsurveyresearch.wordpress.com/ New Coverage of Big Data (used by popular web sites like Amazon and Netflix) and the ethical issues which emerge not only about privacy, but also how it relates to the methods discussed in this book about sampling, probability, and research design.

We estimate that the increase in mortality from higher electricity prices outnumbers the mortality from the accident itself, suggesting the decision to cease nuclear production has contributed to more deaths than the accident itself.},

In each, a controversial issue was framed in one of two ways. We measured framing's influence on belief content, belief importance, and issue opinion. In both experiments, framing significantly affected issue opinion. Causal analysis shows that framing independently affected belief content and belief importance, and that each contributed to issue opinion.},

While many observers of political communication and the mass media have discussed framing, few have explicitly described how framing affects public opinion. In this paper we offer a theory of framing effects, with a specific focus on the psychological mechanisms by which framing influences political attitudes. We discuss important conceptual differences between framing and traditional theories of persuasion that focus on belief change. We outline a set of hypotheses about the interaction between framing and audience sophistication, and test these in an experiment. The results support our argument that framing is not merely persuasion, as it is traditionally conceived. We close by reflecting on the various routes by which political communications can influence attitudes.},

We develop experimental evidence on cooperation and response to sanctions by running prisoner's dilemma and third party punishment games on three different pools of subjects; students, ordinary criminals and Camorristi (Neapolitan `Mafiosi'). The latter two groups were recruited from within prisons. Camorra prisoners show a high degree of cooperativeness and a strong tendency to punish defectors, as well as a clear rejection of the imposition of external rules even at significant cost to themselves. The subsequent econometric analysis further enriches our understanding demonstrating inter alia that individuals' locus of control and reciprocity are associated with quite different and opposing behaviours amongst different participant types; a strong sense of self-determination and reciprocity both imply a higher propensity to punish for Camorra inmates, but quite the opposite for ordinary criminals, further reinforcing the contrast between the behaviour of ordinary criminals and the strong internal mores of Camorra clans.},

The result, according to the experts, is an ignorant public, helpless targets of a one-way flow of carefully filtered and orchestrated communication. Common Knowledge shatters this pervasive myth. Reporting on a ground-breaking study, the authors reveal that our shared knowledge and evolving political beliefs are determined largely by how we actively reinterpret the images, fragments, and signals we find in the mass media.  For their study, the authors analyzed coverage of 150 television and newspaper stories on five prominent issues---drugs, AIDS, South African apartheid, the Strategic Defense Initiative, and the stock market crash of October 1987. They tested audience responses of more than 1,600 people, and conducted in-depth interviews with a select sample. What emerges is a surprisingly complex picture of people actively and critically interpreting the news, making sense of even the most abstract issues in terms of their own lives, and finding political meaning in a sophisticated interplay of message, medium, and firsthand experience.  At every turn, Common Knowledge refutes conventional wisdom. It shows that television is far more effective at raising the saliency of issues and promoting learning than is generally assumed; it also undermines the assumed causal connection between newspaper reading and higher levels of political knowledge. Finally, this book gives a deeply responsible and thoroughly fascinating account of how the news is conveyed to us, and how we in turn convey it to others, making meaning of at once so much and so little. For anyone who makes the news---or tries to make anything of it---Common Knowledge promises uncommon wisdom.},

However, many millions in the Western world strongly believe things that are barely ever mentioned in the mainstream media, just as many millions also firmly reject or ignore some of the messages that are repeated incessantly by them. This confirms sixty years of experimental psychology research showing that most individuals are capable of preserving their beliefs, even in the face of overwhelming evidence, argument and logic to the contrary. Consistent with this, political science research finds little evidence of strong media influence on the party voting, political attitudes and election agendas of citizens. They have their own ways of gathering political information about the world around them, and they do not necessarily believe what they read in the papers, unless they are so inclined to start with. Consequently, media influences on mass opinion and behaviour are weaker than commonly assumed and, such as they are, their effects are more beneficial than harmful for democracy.},

  abstract = {The rise of the internet and other technology has made information more easily-accessible than ever before. While this has had the positive effect of equalizing access to knowledge, it also has lowered the bar on what depth of knowledge is required to consider oneself an "expert." A cult ofanti-expertise sentiment has coincided with anti-intellectualism, resulting in massively viral yet poorly informed debates ranging from the anti-vaccination movement to attacks on GMOs. This surge in intellectual egalitarianism has altered the landscape of debates - all voices are equal, and "fact"is a subjective term. Browsing WebMD puts one on equal footing with doctors, and Wikipedia allows all to be foreign policy experts, scientists, and more.As Tom Nichols shows in The Death of Expertise, there are a number of reasons why this has occurred - ranging from easy access to Internet search engines to a customer satisfaction model within higher education. The product of these interrelated trends, Nichols argues, is a pervasive distrust ofexpertise among the public coinciding with an unfounded belief among non-experts that their opinions should have equal standing with those of the experts. The experts are not always right, of course, and Nichols discusses expert failure. The crucial point is that bad decisions by experts can andhave been effectively challenged by other well-informed experts. The issue now is that the democratization of information dissemination has created an army of ill-informed citizens who denounce expertise.When challenged, non-experts resort to the false argument that the experts are often wrong. Though it may be true, but the solution is not to jettison expertise as an ideal; it is to improve our expertise. Nichols is certainly not opposed to information democratization, but rather the enlightenmentpeople believe they achieve after superficial internet research. He shows in vivid detail the ways in which this impulse is coursing through our culture and body politic, but the larger goal is to explain the benefits that expertise and rigorous learning regimes bestow upon all societies.},

  abstract = {Since 2017, four provincial legislatures have introduced bills invoking the controversial notwithstanding clause. We present an original dataset of news articles from 10 different outlets that discussed the clause while these bills were being debated in Saskatchewan and Ontario. Empirically, although the clause is typically portrayed accurately, we find over one-fifth of articles about the clause did not indicate that it must be included in legislation. Normatively, the clause was twice as likely to be portrayed negatively as it was positively, and the type of portrayal was strongly associated with the ideological orientation of the news outlet. The rate of negative portrayals was similar across the two provinces, which suggests that attitudes toward the clause may endure beyond the policy issue itself or the level of media visibility.},

  abstract = {Power in policy making revolves in part around the ability to control media attention to an issue while framing an issue in favorable terms. These two characteristics of media coverage both reflect and shape where an issue is decided, by whom, and with what outcomes. In understanding this process, a number of studies have observed cyclical waves in media attention and historical shifts in how an issue is framed, linking these features to policy decisions. Yet there has been little theoretical specification and testing of the social mechanisms that drive these cycles. With this in mind, this study outlines a model for understanding "mediated issue development." The theoretical components of the model include the type of policy arena where debate takes place,the media lobbying activities of strategic actors,the journalistic need for narrative structure, and the competition from other issues for attention across policy and media environments. Related factors include the type of journalist assigned coverage and the level of attention from opinion pages. Using data from a content analysis of twenty-five years of coverage at the New York Times and Washington Post, the model is applied and tested against the issue of plant biotechnology. Generalizability of the model is the primary goal,and the authors conclude with comparisons to other issues such as the Human Genome Project and intelligent design. Understanding, however, why plant biotechnology remains at low levels of controversy in the United States compared to the rest of the world remains the object of considerable curiosity, and the focus of this study posits several explanations.}

Yet, instead of a fully informed and deliberative public, past research indicates that it is more likely that the public by nature is 'miserly', with individuals relying on their value predispositions and only the information most readily available to them from the mass media and other sources in order to formulate an opinion about science controversy. Building on this latter 'accessibility' or 'memory-based' model of opinion formation, this study tests the relationship between an increase in available information-or increasing 'awareness'-and public support for embryonic stem cell research. An analysis of national survey data collected in the USA during the fall of 2001 and the fall of 2002 indicates that although an increase in awareness leads to an increase in support for research, both religious and ideological value predispositions strongly moderate the impact of awareness.}

Protein levels of CYP1A1 and GST in embryonic livers were estimated by Western immunoblotting. Exposure in utero to BPA [0.02 (1/100 dose of environmental exposure), 2, 200, and 20,000 microg/kg/day] increased AhR mRNA expression in the cerebra, cerebella, and gonads (testes and ovaries) of male and female mid-and late-developmental stage (14.5- and 18.5-dpc, respectively) embryos. BPA dose-independently up-regulated the expression of AhRR and Arnt in mid- and late-stage embryos. BPA had no remarkable effect on the mRNA levels of XMEs in mid-stage embryos, but dose-dependently up-regulated the expression in late-stage embryos. Moreover, the protein levels of these enzymes in the livers of late-stage embryos were increased. The present findings revealed that exposure to BPA in utero disrupts the expression of AhR and related factors and of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes, and that mid-stage embryos, in the organogenic stage, are sensitive to BPA.},

Higher levels of RARalpha mRNA in cerebra of male and female embryos of control groups were detected at 14.5 dpc. In utero BPA reduced the RARalpha mRNA expression. Higher levels of RXRalpha mRNA in cerebra of male and female embryos were seen at 12.5 dpc. The exposure decreased RXRalpha mRNA expression in male but not female embryos. No remarkable change in the RARalpha mRNA expression level was noted in cerebella of male or female embryos of the control group during embryonic development. Exposure to BPA increased expression levels of RARalpha mRNA in cerebella of male and female embryos at 12.5 dpc.

In utero exposure to BPA at 2, 200, and 20,000 microg/kg/day also increased levels of AhR mRNA.

However, a few have considered the possibility that polarization may instead affect social media usage. To address this gap, the study uses Dutch panel data to test directionality in the relationship between social media use and affective polarization. No support was found for the hypothesis that social media use contributed to the level of affective polarization. Instead, the results lend support to the hypothesis that it was the level of affective polarization that affected subsequent use of social media. The results furthermore reveal heterogeneous patterns among individuals, depending on their previous level of social media usage, and across different social media platforms. The study gives reason to call into question the predominating assumption in previous research that social media is a major driver of polarization in society.},

We present results to two experiments conducted during the 2016 campaign that test the effects of exposure to realistic journalistic fact-checks of claims made by Donald Trump during his convention speech and a general election debate. These messages improved the accuracy of respondents' factual beliefs, even among his supporters, but had no measurable effect on attitudes toward Trump.

Yet, to date, no systematic work on the diffusion of smoke-free spaces bylaws has been reported. We examined the diffusion of municipal smoke-free bylaws over a 30-year period in the provinces of Alberta and Ontario, Canada, to begin to address this gap and to determine whether spatial patterns could be identified to help explain the nature of policy development. Bylaw adoption and change were analysed within local, regional, and provincial contexts. Geographical models of hierarchical and expansion diffusion in conjunction with the diffusion of innovations framework conceptually guided the analyses. Study findings contribute to a broader understanding of how and why health policies diffuse across time and place. Policy development can be a powerful mechanism for creating environments that support healthy decisions; hence, an understanding of policy diffusion is critical for those interested in policy interventions aimed at improving population health in any jurisdiction.},

Crude extracts demonstrated inhibition of each of these five enzymes, with CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 being more sensitive than CYP1A2 and CYP2C19. Extracts were fractionated by HPLC, and each of the fractions was tested for inhibition of these five CYPs to identify individual constituents with inhibitory activity. Several fractions were shown to possess inhibitory activity, including the fractions containing hyperforin (the putative active antidepressant constituent), I3,II8-biapigenin, and hypericin. Hyperforin and I3,II8-biapigenin were isolated from the extract, and inhibition constants for the five CYP activities were measured. In addition, three other constituents, hypericin, quercetin, and chlorogenic acid, were tested for inhibitory activity toward the CYP enzymes. The flavonoid compound I3, II8-biapigenin was shown to be a potent, competitive inhibitor of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP1A2 activities with K-i values of 0.038, 0.32, and 0.95 mu M, respectively. Hyperforin was a potent noncompetitive inhibitor of CYP2D6 activity (K-i = 1.5 mu M) and competitive inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 activities (K-i = 1.8 and 0.48 mu M, respectively). Hypericin also demonstrated potent inhibition of several CYP activities. These in vitro data indicate that St. John's wort preparations contain constituents that can potently inhibit the activities of major human drug-metabolizing enzymes and suggest that these preparations should be examined for potential pharmacokinetic drug interactions in vivo.},

CJ-12,764, a benzyl alcohol analog, was observed as a major metabolite, and a dehydrogenated metabolite (CJ-12,458) was equally important in human liver microsomes. Scale-up of the liver microsomal intrinsic clearance data and correcting for both serum protein binding and nonspecific microsomal binding yielded predicted hepatic clearance values that showed a good correlation with in vivo systemic blood clearance values. Including microsomal binding was necessary to achieve agreement between hepatic clearance values predicted from in vitro data and systemic clearance values measured in vivo. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, 3A5, and 2D6 demonstrated the ability to metabolize ezlopitant to CJ-12,458 and CJ-12,764. However, in liver microsomes, the CYP3A isoforms appear to play a substantially more important role in the metabolism of ezlopitant than CYP2D6, as assessed through the use of CYP-specific inhibitors, correlation to isoform-specific marker substrate activities, and appropriate scale-up of enzyme kinetic data generated in microsomes containing individual heterologously expressed recombinant CYP isoforms. The apparent predominance of CYP3A over CYP2D6 is consistent with observations of the pharmacokinetics of ezlopitant in humans in vivo.},

Data were gathered from a sample of registered voters, with the results showing strong support for the theory developed. The results indicated strong influences for demographics on voter involvement, resulting in a significant influence of involvement on political opinion leadership. Political opinion leadership was also shown to influence subjective voter knowledge and knowledge impacting on voter decision confidence. The findings also confirmed a strong difference in voter satisfaction depending on voter involvement. The findings have significant implications,for political marketing and voter-behavior research.

However, theory of marketing by political parties could be said to be in a pre-paradigmatic stage, as there is no general theory of political marketing. This is not to say a general theory is preferable or even possible, but it does present the discipline with a number of issues and raises many questions about moving political marketing to a stronger theory base. Such a stage of development presents great opportunities for those interested in political marketing to identify and debate many of the important aspects of applying marketing to political campaigns, which raises significant theoretical and practical issues. One such issue relates to the foundation of political marketing, which is being built on by theory from the commercial marketing domain. This does not lessen the discipline, but opens up opportunities to explore the nature of political marketing and debate the transition, smooth or otherwise, of commercial marketing theory into the political domain. It also provides opportunity to discuss the development by political parties of specific capabilities to deliver greater value to the voter-citizen, and what resources and capabilities are needed to do this. These two theoretical platforms highlight two major issues that if brought together offer significant opportunities to advance the discipline of political marketing - these being the resource-based view of the firm and value creation and delivery.},

Accordingly, this article argues that the class map has to be redrawn in order to grasp these changes in the employment structure. For that purpose, it develops the bases of a new class schema that partly shifts its focus from hierarchical divisions to horizontal cleavages. The middle class is not conceptualized as a unitary grouping and the manual/non-manual divide is not used as a decisive class boundary. Instead, emphasis is put on differences in marketable skills and the work logic. The schema is expected to more accurately reflect the class location of unskilled service employees and to make visible the political divide within the salaried middle class. This expectation is empirically examined with survey data from Britain, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland. Findings for earnings and promotion prospects indicate that the schema successfully captures the hierarchical dimension in the class structure. Moreover, results for party support and union membership suggest that the schema grasps a salient horizontal cleavage between managers and sociocultural professionals.},

To understand radical right voters' gender attitudes, I first analyze previous research for frames that antifeminist actors commonly use to advance their arguments. I then draw on interviews with eastern German radical right voters to analyze whether and how these voters apply antifeminist frames to argue about feminist policy. I demonstrate that they use antifeminist frames to oppose mostly third-wave and recently salient feminist issues, but also support certain feminist policies, sometimes for instrumental reasons. Further, voters include particularities of their context in their arguments. Eastern Germany constitutes an atypical context, allowing for insights into voters' (anti)feminism in a post-socialist context marked by atheism and relatively advanced gender norms. The study contributes to understanding complexities and nuances in radical right voters' gender attitudes, and thereby to understanding cultural grievances beyond anti-immigration attitudes.},

This is tested in the gender-equal context of Sweden by analysing national elections data from 2014 to 2018, comparing voting behaviour before and after a period marked by strong gender issue salience. The study demonstrates that (a) the gap between conservatives' and liberals' gender values widens, and (b) conservative gender values predict PRR voting in Sweden in 2018 but not in 2014. These findings suggest that salience of liberalising gender values may trigger backlash, which in turn fuels PRR voting.},

A student of Socrates, Xenophon (430-355 BC) found personal fulfillment and professional expertise with Cyrus the Great and the Persian Empire. His writings provide a theoretical side of Socrates as well as a practical view of an effective leadership style found in Ancient Persia. While Plato wrote on an ideal government led by a philosopher, Xenophon served as a leader himself and then wrote about the exceptional qualities of leadership he admired in Cyrus the Great. His key work, Cyropaedia (Education of Cyrus) explains the virtues and characteristics of an ideal leader. Education, equality, consensus, justice, and service to state as well as to the broad-based public are the qualities embodied in Cyrus the Great. These values have clear implications for modern public administration. A great body of research has been developed over the years on leadership but perhaps what public leaders need most can be found in the writings of a simple, practical, and virtuous individual, Xenophon who lived 2400 years ago and presented the exceptional characteristics of ideal leadership in Cyrus of Persia.}

  abstract = {Research suggests that cultural worldviews bias how and what people think about various societal risks. But how does this mechanism manifest when people receive balanced information about a highly publicised health issue such as cigarette smoking? Using the cultural cognition worldview scales, we demonstrate that despite the considerable interventions post the 1964 landmark Surgeon General's Report, young adults in the U.S. still perceive smoking risks in ways that affirm their cultural worldviews along two dimensions: egalitarianism-hierarchism and individualism-communitarianism. Those who subscribe to hierarchical and individualistic worldviews were more dismissive of the risks associated with cigarette smoking and exposure, while egalitarians and communitarians associated smoking with higher risks. We observed an interaction between the two worldview dimensions. Besides, exposed to balanced information -- as is often the case in media coverage based on the journalistic norm of balance -- about the risks and benefits of smoking, those who are concurrently hierarchical and individualistic in their outlook assimilated information about benefits while discounting the dangers of smoking. Egalitarian communitarians (on the other end of the continuum) discounted the benefits information vis-{\`a}-vis the risk information. Thus, culturally-biased cognition of risk perception does not only apply to novel and abstract risks but also highly publicised ones. Communication and public policy implications are discussed.},

The class vote in Canada is re-examined using a new measure which takes into account voter perceptions of the class positions of the political parties. The results indicate that voter interest in class issues is greater than previously thought. This, in turn, suggests that the main source of the anomaly associated with the Canadian case resides, not with the Canadians themselves, but with the nature of the electoral options presented to them. This finding suggests that one cannot assume that the politics of a democracy faithfully reflect the salient concerns of its citizens. The results also suggest that conventional measures of voting behaviour, which normally fail to take into account the variable nature of electoral options, provide a poor indicator of the nature of mass sentiment.}

Conventional measures indicate that the power of the labour movement in Canada increased after Potter studied it around 1960 but that it has subsequently declined. Support from ideological and state elites seems to have followed a similar rise and decline pattern. Foreign influence has been considerably reduced. The movement remains highly decentralized. In contrast to the situation in 1960, unions are now notably female, white collar and public sector. A partial study of the social characteristics of the labour elite indicates that its ethnic origins have become less British and more French Canadian. The "other ethnic" proportion of the elite has been stable. Virtually no visible minority representation was detected. Given changes in the ethno-racial composition of the population, it would appear that under-representation of the non Charter Group categories has increased significantly over the past four decades. Conversely, female representation in the elite has grown substantially. (English)},

Other critics of statistics take a strong social constructivist approach to research methodology. One problem with these sceptics' arguments is that they confuse the method of analytical statistics with the methodology of empiricism. We disentangle the two, and present a constructive argument supporting the cautious use of analytical statistics. The first part of the paper argues the case for an interpretive approach to statistical findings. In the middle of the paper an exemplar is presented showing that multivariate regression results can offer nonintuitive findings, can support non-atomistic interpretations, and can help underpin retroductive explanatory arguments. In exploring the nature of the warranted arguments that can arise after doing analytical statistics, we stress that explanations are emergent and do rest upon the workings of the statistical techniques and practices. We argue against seeing statistical techniques as a 'black box'. Instead, arguments can be developed, with justification resting in part upon the statistical results, in an audience-specific context of argumentation. The data which underlie statistical methods are not factual; the data are more like ficts than facts. Our argument is therefore that warranted arguments can be and are developed by social scientists who may use analytical statistics alongside other methods of research. Details of the argument can be explored further but it is important to establish that the sceptics' arguments are too dismissive of multivariate statistical analysis.}

  abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between the strategic postures and political market orientation profile of two Danish parties. Profile stability at the organisational level is used as a control variable. Design/methodology/approach - The strategic political postures of two Danish parties are derived using a self-typing study. Based on configuration theory, ideal organisational profiles to implement these studies are juxtaposed with the actual political market orientation profile for each party, gained from two datasets analysed using Partial Least Squares. Member activity levels are used to control for organisational stability. Findings - The self-typing study revealed that Party A was perceived to follow a relationship builder posture, and Party B a convinced ideologist posture. However, both market orientation profiles resembled the organisational structures of a convinced ideologist. Thus, Party A exhibits a mismatch between strategic orientation and implemented organisational profile, based on configuration theory. The results were generally stable across political activity levels. Research limitations/implications - The investigation represents an intra-group analysis, i.e. it is concerned only with two parties in one political system; however, this reflects the oligopolistic character of the vast majority of electoral markets and thus, further research could compare results across political systems. A link with performance variables needs to be established to assess the extent to which the organisational alignment results in competitive advantages for a party. Practical implications - Whilst there exists a general cohesiveness within parties regarding the overall strategic posture, political managers need to be aware of the subtle differences that can affect the market orientation of different groups within the party. Originality/value - The study contributes to understanding the concept of market orientation in the political sphere. More specifically, it empirically links political market orientation as an issue of political marketing implementation on the one hand, and strategic postures of parties as a strategic issue on the other, following a configuration theory logic.},

We are in a new era, when the terrorist act does not simply speak for itself via its symbolism, but is amplified through a vast constellation of modern media. We explore the symbolism inherent in the construction of selected Islamist audio-visual propaganda made available on the internet today and seek to access the `meaning' of terrorist visualities through semiotic analysis, particularly using the Positioning Triad (Baines et al., 2008) and the deconstruction technique (Derrida, 1967) to encourage a new thread of political marketing/propaganda research.

We conceptualize risk in terms of two components, social and electoral, and demonstrate that women are more risk-averse regarding both. Our analysis is based on public opinion data from 14 countries (2002--16) combined with macrolevel data on PRRPs' past parliamentary fortunes. To distinguish between the social and electoral components in risk-taking, we use the illustrative case study of Germany. Findings demonstrate that gender differences in risk-taking and, by implication, the differences between women's and men's responses to the electoral context are key to understanding the voting gender gap.},

There was significant activity from the emission extract when compared to the positive control, 0.1 nM estradiol. After HPLC fractionation, GC/MS identified ten chemicals which included bisphenol A; the brominated derivates mono-, di-, and tribisphenol, triphenyl phosphate, triphenyl phosphine oxide, 4'-bromo-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol,3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxybiphenyl,3,5-dibromo-2-hydroxybiphenyl, and the oxygenated polyaromatic hydrocarbon benzanthrone.

The compound 4'-bromo-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol resulted in dose-dependent significant increases for luciferase activity at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10 microM in the T47D-KBluc assay. The chemical also demonstrated an affinity for binding to the estrogen receptor (ER) with an IC50 of 2 x 10(-7) M. To determine the uterotrophic activity, three doses (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg/day) of 4'-bromo-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol were administered to adult ovariectomized Long-Evans rats for 3 days. Treatment of the animals with 200 mg/ kg/day showed an increase in uterine weight Hence one new chemical, released by burning of electrical wastes, was identified which displays estrogenic activity both in vitro and in vivo. However, it was about 1000-fold less potent than ethynyl estradiol.},

  abstract = {Using low information rationality, citizens can compensate for their lack of political knowledge by turning to experts to help interpret and economize information. However, citizens must navigate a political media environment that is oversaturated with unqualified sources and competing cues, leading some scholars to question whether individuals are willing or able to utilize low-information rationality effectively. Much prior work focuses on partisan motivated reasoning, asserting that the influence of partisanship overwhelms that of other relevant informational cues. This is refuted by a relatively smaller subset of works, finding that the influence of partisanship is often diminished by contextual cues. I address this debate with two experimental designs that place source cues in a competing context by simultaneously manipulating expertise-related cues and partisan cues. I find that individuals do take source expertise and credibility into account, even when confronted with competing partisan source cues, helping to somewhat mitigate partisan biases.},

Page shows how the New York Times presented a restricted set of opinions on whether to go to war with Iraq, shutting out discussion of compromises favored by many Americans. He then examines the media's negative reaction to the Bush administration's claim that riots in Los Angeles were caused by welfare programs. Finally, he shows how talk shows overcame the elite media's indifference to widespread concern about Zoe Baird's hiring of illegal aliens. Page's provocative conclusion identifies the conditions under which media outlets become political actors and actively shape and limit the ideas and information available to the public. Arguing persuasively that a diversity of viewpoints is essential to true public deliberation, this book will interest students of American politics, communications, and media studies.},

This Addendum (2008) has been prepared by the UK in the frame of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 793/93 on the evaluation and control of the risks of existing substances, following the principles for assessment of the risks to man and the environment, laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1488/94. The evaluation considers the emissions and the resulting exposure to the environment and the human populations in all life cycle steps. Following the exposure assessment, the environmental risk characterisation for each protection goal in the aquatic, terrestrial and atmospheric compartment has been determined. This Addendum of environmental risk assessment for Bisphenol-A, concludes that there is concern to the freshwater and marine aquatic compartments (including sediment, since the equilibrium partitioning approach has been used). Although no risks are indicated using the freshwater and marine PNEC for any scenario, there are still some uncertainties over the potential effects of bisphenol-A on snails, despite the thorough testing undertaken as part of the conclusion (i) programme. The human health risk assessment for Bisphenol-A concludes that there is concern forworkers. This conclusion is reached in relation to repeated dose systemic effects and for reproductive toxicity during the manufacture of BPA and the manufacture of epoxy resins. In addition, there are concerns for skin sensitisation in all occupational exposure scenarios where there is the potential for skin contact with high concentrations (greater than 30\%) of BPA. The format of the report is broadly in line with that of the original (2003) risk assessment. Significant new information is summarised in this updated (2008) risk assessment and a comment is added to indicate how this affects the findings from the original risk assessment.},

This stimulating book argues that concentration on class actually diverts attention from other more central and more morally problematic inequalities.

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}In order to control the spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19, it will be important to develop a communication strategy to counteract ``vaccine hesitancy''. This paper reports the results of a survey experiment testing the impacts of several types of message content: the safety and efficacy of the vaccine itself, the likelihood that others will take the vaccine, and the possible role of politics in promoting the vaccine. In an original survey of 1123 American M-Turk respondents, we provided six different information conditions suggesting the safety and efficacy of the vaccine, the lack of safety/efficacy of the vaccine, the suggestion that most others would take the vaccine, the suggestion that most others would not take the vaccine, the suggestion that the vaccine is being promoted to gain greater control over individual freedom, and the suggestion that it is being rushed for political motivations. We compared the responses for those in the treatment groups with a control group who received no additional information. In comparison to the control group, those who received information about the safety/efficacy of the vaccine were more likely to report that they would take the vaccine, those who received information that others were reluctant to take the vaccine were more likely to report that they themselves would not take it, that other Americans would not take it, and that it was not important to get the vaccine, and those who received information about political influences on vaccine development expressed hesitancy to take it. Communication of effective messages about the vaccine will be essential for public health agencies that seek to promote vaccine take-up.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

White males and Taiwanese-American males perceived health and technology risks as low compared to others and endorsed an individualist rather than an egalitarian worldview.

There is general agreement that recent changes in political life - especially the decline of party affiliation and the increased importance of the mass media - have led to the changes associated with political marketing. The article debates the question by examining themes in professional literature that variously support and oppose the proposition that political marketing is all style and no substance.

The two main research objectives are firstly to establish the key factors affecting voters' trust when it comes to using politicians' websites and secondly to examine whether and to what extent the influence of trust-building factors changes over-time, as the online environment matures. The key findings of this research are that users tend to visit the websites of favoured candidates, which reinforces their positive perceptions of them, while as far as the websites themselves and their content and the services provided are concerned there is still room for improvement.

Papert argues that children are more than capable of mastering computers, and that teaching computational processes like de-bugging in the classroom can change the way we learn everything else. He also shows that schools saturated with technology can actually improve socialization and interaction among students and between students and teachers.Technology changes every day, but the basic ways that computers can help us learn remain.

It was found that these companies responded to those criticisms and developed a long-term campaign that tapped into contemporary cultural concerns not only to sell product but also to educate consumers about purity, health values, and domestic success.

On the basis of the general literature about the formation and structure of attitudes and about public perceptions of science, this article presents a new metric and analysis: first, for estimating the level of awareness and knowledge of biotechnology in Europe; second, for assessing the stability and depth of these evaluative perceptions; and third, for exploring the roles of canonical socio-demographic variables, the knowledge variable and general attitudinal schemas for understanding the perceptions of both benefits and risks of biotech applications. The results show the importance of general value orientations or "worldviews" in shaping positive attitudes, and more of these general cognitive schemas should be measured in future research. The same multivariate model was unable to account for a significant percentage of the total variance in the perception of risks, suggesting that new measures are needed to tap this critical area in the acceptance of biotech in Europe.

  abstract = {The term ?learning styles? refers to the concept that individuals differ in regard to what mode of instruction or study is most effective for them. Proponents of learning-style assessment contend that optimal instruction requires diagnosing individuals' learning style and tailoring instruction accordingly. Assessments of learning style typically ask people to evaluate what sort of information presentation they prefer (e.g., words versus pictures versus speech) and/or what kind of mental activity they find most engaging or congenial (e.g., analysis versus listening), although assessment instruments are extremely diverse. The most common?but not the only?hypothesis about the instructional relevance of learning styles is the meshing hypothesis, according to which instruction is best provided in a format that matches the preferences of the learner (e.g., for a ?visual learner,? emphasizing visual presentation of information).The learning-styles view has acquired great influence within the education field, and is frequently encountered at levels ranging from kindergarten to graduate school. There is a thriving industry devoted to publishing learning-styles tests and guidebooks for teachers, and many organizations offer professional development workshops for teachers and educators built around the concept of learning styles.The authors of the present review were charged with determining whether these practices are supported by scientific evidence. We concluded that any credible validation of learning-styles-based instruction requires robust documentation of a very particular type of experimental finding with several necessary criteria. First, students must be divided into groups on the basis of their learning styles, and then students from each group must be randomly assigned to receive one of multiple instructional methods. Next, students must then sit for a final test that is the same for all students. Finally, in order to demonstrate that optimal learning requires that students receive instruction tailored to their putative learning style, the experiment must reveal a specific type of interaction between learning style and instructional method: Students with one learning style achieve the best educational outcome when given an instructional method that differs from the instructional method producing the best outcome for students with a different learning style. In other words, the instructional method that proves most effective for students with one learning style is not the most effective method for students with a different learning style.Our review of the literature disclosed ample evidence that children and adults will, if asked, express preferences about how they prefer information to be presented to them. There is also plentiful evidence arguing that people differ in the degree to which they have some fairly specific aptitudes for different kinds of thinking and for processing different types of information. However, we found virtually no evidence for the interaction pattern mentioned above, which was judged to be a precondition for validating the educational applications of learning styles. Although the literature on learning styles is enormous, very few studies have even used an experimental methodology capable of testing the validity of learning styles applied to education. Moreover, of those that did use an appropriate method, several found results that flatly contradict the popular meshing hypothesis.We conclude therefore, that at present, there is no adequate evidence base to justify incorporating learning-styles assessments into general educational practice. Thus, limited education resources would better be devoted to adopting other educational practices that have a strong evidence base, of which there are an increasing number. However, given the lack of methodologically sound studies of learning styles, it would be an error to conclude that all possible versions of learning styles have been tested and found wanting; many have simply not been tested at all. Further research on the use of learning-styles assessment in instruction may in some cases be warranted, but such research needs to be performed appropriately.},

At the same time, the scientific community has sought to improve its communication practices, in order to present a more accurate picture to the public and policy makers of the state of scientific knowledge about climate change. In this review article, we examine two sets of insights that could influence the success of such communication efforts. The first set questions which uncertainties matter for effective climate policy. While the literature has focused disproportionately on uncertainties with respect to the climate system, we draw attention here to uncertainties associated with the solution space. The second set examines which factors lead people to take slow and deliberated decisions versus quick and spontaneous ones, and looks at the results of these two systems of thought on climate change action. From the review of these two sets of literature, we propose a new hypothesis: that the gap between public and scientific attitudes toward climate change will narrow not because of greater attention to and communication of climate system risks and uncertainties, but rather out of growing experience with the policies and technological systems needed to address the problem.

For decades, this mantra was invoked by scientists in order to avoid taking positions as to whether one thing caused another, such as smoking and cancer, or carbon dioxide and global warming. But today, that taboo is dead. The causal revolution, sparked by world-renowned computer scientist Judea Pearl and his colleagues, has cut through a century of confusion and placed cause and effect on a firm scientific basis. Now, Pearl and science journalist Dana Mackenzie explain causal thinking to general readers for the first time, showing how it allows us to explore the world that is and the worlds that could have been. It is the essence of human and artificial intelligence. And just as Pearl's discoveries have enabled machines to think better, The Book of Why explains how we too can think better.'Pearl's accomplishments over the last 30 years have provided the theoretical basis for progress in artificial intelligence and have redefined the term "thinking machine"' Vint Cerf},

  abstract = {The 2016 US Presidential Election brought considerable attention to the phenomenon of ``fake news'': entirely fabricated and often partisan content that is presented as factual. Here we demonstrate one mechanism that contributes to the believability of fake news: fluency via prior exposure. Using actual fake news headlines presented as they were seen on Facebook, we show that even a single exposure increases subsequent perceptions of accuracy, both within the same session and after a week. Moreover, this ``illusory truth effect'' for fake news headlines occurs despite a low level of overall believability, and even when the stories are labeled as contested by fact checkers or are inconsistent with the reader's political ideology. These results suggest that social media platforms help to incubate belief in blatantly false news stories, and that tagging such stories as disputed is not an effective solution to this problem. Interestingly, however, we also find that prior exposure does not impact entirely implausible statements (e.g., ``The Earth is a perfect square''). These observations indicate that although extreme implausibility is a boundary condition of the illusory truth effect, only a small degree of potential plausibility is sufficient for repetition to increase perceived accuracy. As a consequence, the scope and impact of repetition on beliefs is greater than previously assumed.},

Contrary to a common narrative whereby politics drives susceptibility to fake news, people are `better' at discerning truth from falsehood (despite greater overall belief) when evaluating politically concordant news. Instead, poor truth discernment is associated with lack of careful reasoning and relevant knowledge, and the use of heuristics such as familiarity. Furthermore, there is a substantial disconnect between what people believe and what they share on social media. This dissociation is largely driven by inattention, more so than by purposeful sharing of misinformation. Thus, interventions can successfully nudge social media users to focus more on accuracy. Crowdsourced veracity ratings can also be leveraged to improve social media ranking algorithms.},

Here we focus on pseudo-profound bullshit, which consists of seemingly impressive assertions that are presented as true and meaningful but are actually vacuous. We presented participants with bullshit statements consisting of buzzwords randomly organized into statements with syntactic structure but no discernible meaning (e.g., ``Wholeness quiets infinite phenomena''). Across multiple studies, the propensity to judge bullshit statements as profound was associated with a variety of conceptually relevant variables (e.g., intuitive cognitive style, supernatural belief). Parallel associations were less evident among profundity judgments for more conventionally profound (e.g., ``A wet person does not fear the rain'') or mundane (e.g., ``Newborn babies require constant attention'') statements. These results support the idea that some people are more receptive to this type of bullshit and that detecting it is not merely a matter of indiscriminate skepticism but rather a discernment of deceptive vagueness in otherwise impressive sounding claims. Our results also suggest that a bias toward accepting statements as true may be an important component of pseudo-profound bullshit receptivity.},

What we see now is an increasingly less white society due to intensive immigration processes and interracial marriages. Owing to the recent growth of so-called Latinos in American society, Latin vote has gained such a significant importance that it may become decisive in national elections. The importance of Latino votes in this scenario of uncertainty surrounding the U. S. presidential election - that places face to face the democratic senator Barack Obama and the Republican Sen. John McCain - is given by the fact that Latin voters do not show rigid historical commitments with any party as black people do, and by the fact that the electorate is focused on five states which can be decisive to elect either Democrats or Republicans. They are a group susceptible to persuasion; at the same time, they also have proved to be players with great willingness to negotiate with the two major parties. Based on results of surveys, analysis studies on media coverage and political behavior of Latinos in the United States, this article evaluated the political influence of Latin vote before the outcome of the historic election that led Obama to the White House by analyzing Latin wishes and what Obama and McCain offered. In other words, our eyes turned to look at the agenda of Latin and the responses of Democrats and Republicans for their claims.},

The gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered (GLBT) population is a good example of a demographic group that has been understudied because it is difficult to develop a subsample of sufficient size from typical national samples. Here we exploit the extraordinary size of a 2006 online election day survey (with about 35,000 respondents) to examine how the GLBT community behaves politically. While it will surprise no one that this community bestowed little support on Stephen Harper's Conservative party in the 2006 federal election, the factors behind such a consistent vote pattern are not adequately understood. In order to shed more light on the voting behaviour of the GLBT electorate, we develop a socio-demographic profile of the group, and explore three explanatory angles: 1) salience of issue campaign dynamics, given that the same-sex marriage issue was prominent in 2006; 2) ideological and attitudinal proclivities; and 3) strategic considerations.R{\'e}sum{\'e}.

Scientists acknowledged the significance of the media  in shaping public perceptions of nanotechnologies and saw a role for  the media in public engagement efforts. Most had criticisms of media  coverage and offered suggestions as to how it could be improved.  However, their comments often revealed a one-dimensional conception of  science mediation that overlooked the influence of their own claims.

Furthermore, affect and worldviews each contribute independently to the prediction of nuclear support. We find also that a person's affective imagery associated with nuclear power is systematically related to their worldviews. We conclude that affect and worldviews appear to play similar roles as orienting mechanisms, helping people navigate in a complex, uncertain, and sometimes dangerous world.

To compare and contrast methods and findings from two approaches to valuation used in the same survey: measurement of ``attitudes'' using simple rankings and ratings versus measurement of ``preferences'' using conjoint analysis. Conjoint analysis, a stated preference method, involves comparing scenarios composed of attribute descriptions by ranking, rating, or choosing scenarios. We explore possible explanations for our findings using focus groups conducted after the quantitative survey. Methods. A self-administered survey, measuring attitudes and preferences for HIV tests, was conducted at HIV testing sites in San Francisco in 1999--2000 (n=365, response rate=96 percent). Attitudes were measured and analyzed using standard approaches. Conjoint analysis scenarios were developed using a fractional factorial design and results analyzed using random effects probit models. We examined how the results using the two approaches were both similar and different. Results. We found that ``attitudes'' and ``preferences'' were generally consistent, but there were some important differences. Although rankings based on the attitude and conjoint analysis surveys were similar, closer examination revealed important differences in how respondents valued price and attributes with ``halo'' effects, variation in how attribute levels were valued, and apparent differences in decision-making processes. Conclusions. To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare attitude surveys and conjoint analysis surveys and to explore the meaning of the results using post-hoc focus groups. Although the overall findings for attitudes and preferences were similar, the two approaches resulted in some different conclusions. Health researchers should consider the advantages and limitations of both methods when determining how to measure what people value.},

This thesis is tested using a pooled time-series multiple regression analysis of 16 advanced industrialized countries spanning the period 1950-95. Globalization - measured both in terms of a country's general `openness' to the world economy and specifically in terms of international trade and direct investment abroad - is found to be positively related both to the widening success gap between unions and social democratic parties and to the growing policy conservatism of social democratic parties.},

Using time series, cross-sectional econometric  modelling, an analysis is made of competing political and economic  determinants of Canadian provincial government fiscal policy during the  1980s and 1990s. It is determined that provincial government spending  responses to trade liberalization are dependent upon the ideology of the  government and conditioned by the degree of provincial unionization. When  relatively high levels of unionization prevail, those governments that  typically spend the most reduce total spending to a lowest common  denominator. However, when unionization is low, provincial government  spending responses to increasing trade openness is primarily compensatory.  This is in contradiction to the ``race to the bottom'' theory.  The contingent nature of the provincial government spending response to  trade openness means that despite overall pressures for fiscal  convergence, political, economic and regional factors continue to  contribute to distinct provincial spending policies.R{\'e}sum{\'e}. Cet article utilise une  mod{\'e}lisation {\'e}conom{\'e}trique transversale en  s{\'e}rie chronologique pour analyser les d{\'e}terminants  politiques et {\'e}conomiques en comp{\'e}tition au niveau de la  politique fiscale du gouvernement provincial canadien durant les  ann{\'e}es 1980 et 1990.

Symptoms of misuse have included the treatment of an unrealistic, extreme scenario as the world's most likely future in the absence of climate policy and the illogical comparison of climate projections across inconsistent global development trajectories. Reasons why such misuse arose include (a) competing demands for scenarios from users in diverse academic disciplines that ultimately conflated exploratory and policy relevant pathways, (b) the evolving role of the IPCC -- which extended its mandate in a way that creates an inter-relationship between literature assessment and literature coordination, (c) unforeseen consequences of employing a temporary approach to scenario development, (d) maintaining research practices that normalize careless use of scenarios, and (e) the inherent complexity and technicality of scenarios in model-based research and in support of policy. Consequently, much of the climate research community is presently off-track from scientific coherence and policy-relevance. Attempts to address scenario misuse within the community have thus far not worked. The result has been the widespread production of myopic or misleading perspectives on future climate change and climate policy. Until reform is implemented, we can expect the production of such perspectives to continue, threatening the overall credibility of the IPCC and associated climate research. However, because many aspects of climate change discourse are contingent on scenarios, there is considerable momentum that will make such a course correction difficult and contested - even as efforts to improve scenarios have informed research that will be included in the IPCC 6th Assessment.},

Previous discussions have generally relied, at least implicitly, on a reflexive application of theories designed to explain welfare state expansion. Such an approach is seriously flawed. Not only is the goal of retrenchment (avoiding blame for cutting existing programs) far different from the goal of expansion (claiming credit for new social benefits), but the welfare state itself vastly alters the terrain on which the politics of social policy is fought out. Only an appreciation of how mature social programs create a new politics can allow us to make sense of the welfare state's remarkable resilience over the past two decades of austerity. Theoretical argument is combined with quantitative and qualitative data from four cases (Britain, the United States, Germany, and Sweden) to demonstrate the shortcomings of conventional wisdom and to highlight the factors that limit or facilitate retrenchment success.},

It revisits the Critical Legal Studies-inspired debates on the topic, but in the context of justiciable socioeconomic rights, such as those found in the South African Constitution. The article explains the "emptiness" of the socioeconomic rights jurisprudence of the South African Constitutional Court by comparing the South African socioeconomic rights narrative to Peter Gabel's account of the manner in which rights discourse enables the status quo to assimilate and defeat social movements. By doing this, the article shows that socioeconomic rights are accomplices to, rather than victims of, the sidelining of the needs they represent, despite their transformative potential. However, since rights remain one of the only viable political tools through which denial of socioeconomic needs may effectively be confronted, we should not abandon rights-discourse but should instead attempt to translate abstract socioeconomic guarantees into concrete legal entitlements.}

  abstract = {The epic successor to one of the most important books of the century: at once a retelling of global history, a scathing critique of contemporary politics, and a bold proposal for a new and fairer economic system. Thomas Piketty's bestselling Capital in the Twenty-First Century galvanized global debate about inequality. In this audacious follow-up, Piketty challenges us to revolutionize how we think about politics, ideology, and history. He exposes the ideas that have sustained inequality for the past millennium, reveals why the shallow politics of right and left are failing us today, and outlines the structure of a fairer economic system. Our economy, Piketty observes, is not a natural fact. Markets, profits, and capital are all historical constructs that depend on choices. Piketty explores the material and ideological interactions of conflicting social groups that have given us slavery, serfdom, colonialism, communism, and hypercapitalism, shaping the lives of billions. He concludes that the great driver of human progress over the centuries has been the struggle for equality and education and not, as often argued, the assertion of property rights or the pursuit of stability. The new era of extreme inequality that has derailed that progress since the 1980s, he shows, is partly a reaction against communism, but it is also the fruit of ignorance, intellectual specialization, and our drift toward the dead-end politics of identity. Once we understand this, we can begin to envision a more balanced approach to economics and politics. Piketty argues for a new ``participatory'' socialism, a system founded on an ideology of equality, social property, education, and the sharing of knowledge and power. Capital and Ideology is destined to be one of the indispensable books of our time, a work that will not only help us understand the world, but that will change it.},

He argues, however, that the tendency of returns on capital to exceed the rate of economic growth will generate extreme inequalities that stir discontent and undermine democratic values if political action is not taken.},

This study tests what would happen if journalists spoke up more in defense of their profession, while simultaneously also testing effects of doing more fact checking. A five-day field experiment manipulated whether an online news portal included fact check stories and opinion pieces defending journalism. Fact checking was beneficial in terms of three democratically desirable outcomes--media trust, epistemic political efficacy, and future news use intent--only when defense of journalism stories were also present. No partisan differences were found in effects: Republicans, Democrats, and Independents were all affected alike. These results have important implications for journalistic practice as well as for theories and methods of news effects.},

In contrast to most advanced democracies, class voting has traditionally been weak in Canada. Using the entire series of the Canadian Election Study (1965--2019), we find the historic pattern of working-class voting for the New Democratic Party (NDP) held outside of Quebec in recent elections, before suddenly falling off in 2019. Starting in 2004, we find a clear and distinct trend where the working class has increased its support for the Conservatives. Although greater partisan sorting is occurring over the economy, cultural issues such as moral traditionalism and anti-immigration are now significant drivers of working-class Conservative support. The findings carry important implications for class-party relationships and reveal that Canada, despite its comparatively weak nativist cleavage, is not immune from the tensions social democratic parties have recently experienced in maintaining cross-class coalitions amid socio-economic structural changes. , R{\'e}sum{\'e} On a accord{\'e} beaucoup d'attention {\`a} l'{\'e}volution du clivage de classe qui a structur{\'e} les conflits politiques au cours du vingti{\`e}me si{\`e}cle.

It does so through multilevel logistic regressions utilizing mixed effects, on a sample of 30 advanced democracies in 102 elections from 1996 to 2016. It finds that higher levels of income inequality significantly reduce turnout and widen the turnout gap between rich and poor. However, it also finds that when party systems are more polarized, low-income earners are mobilized resulting in a significantly reduced income gap in turnout. The findings magnify the negative impacts income inequality can exert on political behavior and contribute to the study of policy offerings as a key moderating mechanism in the relationship.},

I illustrate the shortcomings of Converse's line of reasoning by showing that he misread his two most prominent examples of the electoral consequences of his theory: voting on the Vietnam War in the 1968 New Hampshire primary, and public opinion about the 1948 Taft-Hartley Act. In both cases, voters were better able to sort candidates and policies than Converse reported, despite their lack of ideological sophistication or their knowledge of specific legislation. Converse's interpretive errors here stem from mistaken assumptions about information processing and recall, and from questionable normative standards about what constitute meaningful and competent political orientation. His criteria underestimate the public's ability to make responsible choices, and the effect of campaigns on the choosing process.},

  author = {Porter, John},

  abstract = {Preface from The Vertical Mosaic THIS BOOK is an attempt to examine the hitherto unexplored subjects of social class and power in Canadian society. However, because no one volume can present a total picture of a modern society, or even of some aspect of that society, there is much that is left unsaid in this study, and many fascinating paths that remain for later investigations. I have tried to suggest some of those which time and resources did not permit me to take.The class and power structure of a modern society arouses a great deal of interest. For example, there is the ethical consideration that class differences appear to contradict those values of a democratic society which emphasize equality. Another reason for the interest is psychological: people have ambivalent feelings about power; that is, men of power are respected, idolized, and often endowed with magical qualities, but as well they are viewed with suspicion, as conspirators against the public good. In the middle of the twentieth century there is also the more practical concern that only the ablest people get into top positions, for, at a time marked by keen international competition, no society can rely on a system of privilege as the basis of recruitment to the higher occupational levels. A system of privilege exists where higher occupational levels are preserved, or tend to be preserved, for particular social groups. Where privilege does exist it may be traced to differences in educational opportunity. Consequently, most modern industrial societies have introduced policies to democratize their educational systems, and so help to bring about more equality of opportunity and at the same time to increase the amount of trained ability that is available. At the level of institutional leadership, that is, of elite groups, it is even more crucial that there be no impediments to people of ability getting to the top. Class can be one such obstacle because it seriously impedes the development of skills in persons having initial talent.Those attracted to the subject of power by the "inside dope" that is often found in newspapers and popular magazines will be disappointed with this study. I have included little information that is not readily available to any other researcher. The benefit that I have received from discussions with powerful men is not that I can tell secrets about them, for that has not been my intent, but rather that I have become better oriented to the structures within which these men work.My academic colleagues may be disappointed that I have not presented extensive case studies of particular decisions which elites have made. Valuable and necessary to the understanding of power as such studies might be, my interest has been to look at the institutional context within which decisions are made and to learn something of the type of men who make them. However, I do refer frequently to important decisions, and in the last chapter I try to show how elites co-operate or come into conflict in reaching them.There are many places in this analysis of class and power where I have regretted the inadequacy of the data to give fuller support to the qualified assertions which I have made. Data rarely come in just the form we should like to receive them. Where appropriate I have drawn attention to the tentativeness of the conclusions which must stand as hypotheses for further testing in future investigations. Furthermore, data can be interpreted in different ways according to the theories which investigators use and the values which they hold. Throughout the book I have tried to make explicit the various theories or theoretical considerations about class and power in society which help to make sense of the evidence I have presented.Perhaps less explicit are personal values which have had an influence on the kinds of problems I have sought to analyze. I attach great importance to equality of opportunity on both ethical and practical grounds. I am aware of the criticisms which have been made of the possible development of meritocracies, but I am not convinced that recent extensions of opportunity, particularly in education, are having a detrimental effect on individuals or societies. I believe strongly, too, in the creative role of politics, and in the importance of political institutions as the means through which the major goals of the society can be achieved. Where these values have influenced my interpretation of the facts will, I think, be clear to the reader.In a society which is made up of many cultural groups there is usually some relationship between a person's membership in these groups and his class position and, consequently, his chances of reaching positions of power. Because the Canadian people are often referred to as a mosaic composed of different ethnic groups, the title, "The Vertical Mosaic," was originally given to the chapter which examines the relationship between ethnicity and social class. As the study proceeded, however, the hierarchical relationship between Canada's many cultural groups became a recurring theme in class and power. For example, it became clear that the Canadians of British origin have retained, within the elite structure of the society, the charter group status with which they started out, and that in some institutional settings the French have been admitted as a co-charter group whereas in others they have not. The title, "The Vertical Mosaic," therefore seemed to be an appropriate link between the two parts of the book.-- John Porter, Carleton University, January 1965},

It argues that there is a conceptual and definitional gap in relation to the term `housing aspirations', as distinct from expectations, preferences, choices and needs. The article sets out working definitions of these terms, before discussing the evidence on changing housing (and related) systems. Emerging research has begun to consider whether trends such as declining homeownership, affordability concerns and precarious labour systems across a range of countries are fundamentally changing individuals' aspirations for the forms of housing they aim to access at different stages of their lives. Whilst much of the research into housing aspirations has been considered in terms of tenure, and homeownership in particular, this article suggests that research needs to move beyond tenure and choice frameworks, to consider the range of dimensions that shape aspirations, from the political economy and the State to socialization and individuals' dispositions for housing.},

Using the Oakland Project as a case study, this book discusses each stage of the process of implementation, demonstrating that completion of what might seem to be a simple sequence of events will in fact depend on a complex chain of reciprocal interactions. Each part of the chain must be built with the others in view, so the separation of policy design from implementation is fatal. The first four chapters illustrate the movement from simplicity to complexity. Chapter 5 discusses the number of decision points throughout the process, giving an indication of the magnitude of the task. Chapter 6 examines why project targets may be set even if they are unlikely to be met, considering both the position of those who set targets -- top federal officials who wish large accomplishments from small resources in a short time -- and those who must implement them -- career bureaucrats and local participants characterized by high needs and low cohesion. The last chapter discusses the relationship between the evaluation of programs and the study of their implementation, arguing that tendencies to assimilate the two should be resisted.},

  abstract = {We expect moral behaviour from scientists. Morality implies being a good person and being good at one's profession. The general view appears to be that the vast majority of scientists aim to achieve these high standards. Science prides itself on the 'self-correcting' mechanism in the scientific method, namely the requirement to reproduce findings before they are taken seriously. However, when findings are related to the adverse effects of chemicals there are several features that make this less effective than in some other fields of science. First, is the perception that everyone is exposed to chemicals and observations about chemical danger are immediately applicable to many people. Second, it is often easy to summarize adverse findings in attention-getting headlines seen by the lay public before the slow process of replication and interpretation has time to work. Third, most regulatory toxicology studies on a particular compound are only done once to minimise cost and the use of animals. Finally, the question posed about chemicals--are they safe?--is easy to ask but more difficult to test with appropriate studies. Fabrication of data in regulatory studies was found to occur in several contract laboratories in the 1960s and this lead directly to the introduction of Good Laboratory Practice regulations. Now studies submitted for regulatory purposes must comply with GLP regulations and this has virtually eliminated flawed studies due to fraudulent or careless behaviour. It is possible to discern different ways in which the expected standards have not been met. The first is in the intention of the work. Thus reports that the Roodeplaats Research Laboratory in South Africa was seeking to identify toxins that would kill without trace is an example where the intention is unacceptable. The second is in the conduct of the studies. Here the examples of William McBride and Michael Briggs who falsified data are pertinent. The example of the retraction of reports on the toxicity of ecstasy because the wrong compound had been administered indicates a degree of carelessness in the conduct of the study. The third is in the design and interpretation of studies. The report that genetic modification per se could render potatoes toxic has been criticised because of the inappropriate design and interpretation of the studies. Finally, that the reports of studies are biased because of conflicts of interest. Journals often require a declaration that the author has no financial conflict of interest. However, there are many other conflicts of interest with just as large an impact on the author's impartiality which are omitted from consideration. Gamesmanship has also entered the practice of toxicology, for example where strong assertions about conflict of interest are used to justify particular points of view. The main casualty from fraud, errors and gamesmanship is the perceived status of science itself. It is only gamesmanship that is on the increase. The remedies for these activities are explored.},

  abstract = {It has been predicted that by 2025 there will be an annual shortfall of cereals for feeding the human population of 68.5 million tones. One possible solution is the use of genetically modified (GM) crops, which are already grown extensively (59 million ha of GM crops were planted in 2002) in the USA, South America, Africa and China. Nevertheless, there is considerable disagreement about the advisability of using such crops, particularly in Europe. Obviously, the safety of the food derived from the GM crops is a primary consideration. Safety assessment relies on establishing that the food is substantially equivalent to its non-GM counterpart and specific testing for allergenicity of proteins and toxicity of metabolites and the whole food. There appears to be international agreement on the principles of safety assessment. Safety to the environment is equally important, but will not be covered in this presentation. The public's perception of the risk of new technology is critical to its acceptance. Perception of risk, in turn, depends on the credibility of the source of the information and trust in the regulatory process. In many countries, the public appears to have lost its trust in the scientists and government dealing with GM food, making the acceptability of GM crops uncertain. Of equal importance are the socio-economic factors that impinge on the viability of GM produce. These include intellectual property protection, trade liberalization (through subsidy and tariff barriers in developed countries) and the intensity of bio safety regulations. The socio-economic interests of developed and developing countries may diverge and may even be contradictory in any one country. Acceptance of GM crops will thus depend on detailed issues surrounding particular crops and economies.}

We sign 30 percent fewer petitions than we did ten years ago. Membership in organisations- from the Boy Scouts to political parties and the Church is falling. Ties with friends and relatives are fraying: we're 35 percent less likely to visit our neighbours or have dinner with our families than we were thirty years ago. We watch sport alone instead of with our friends.A century ago, American citizens' means of connecting were at a low point after decades of urbanisation, industrialisation and immigration uprooted them from families and friends. That generation demonstrated a capacity for renewal by creating the organisations that pulled Americans together. Putnam shows how we can learn from them and reinvent common enterprises that will make us secure, productive, happy and hopeful.},

When the economic crisis of the 1970s undermined faith in permanent and sustained growth in welfare programs, the new agenda for social theory concentrated upon the conditions that hindered or favored development. Ironically, both neo-Marxists and conservative economists reached the same conclusion: Welfare programs undermined profitability. The first half of this paper traces these theoretical developments, both in relation to internal de\- bates among social scientists and in regard to external social and economic conditions that shaped the context of theorizing about the welfare state.},

  abstract = {[Background: Community water fluoridation (CWF) is currently experiencing social resistance in Canada. Petitions have been publicly registered, municipal plebiscites have occurred, and media attention is growing. There is now concern among policy leaders whether the practice is acceptable to Canadians. As a result, this study asks: What are public opinions on CWF? Methods: Data were collected in April 2008 from 1,005 Canadian adults by means of a national telephone interview survey using random digit dialling and computer-assisted telephone interview technology. Descriptive and bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were undertaken. Results: Approximately 1 in 2 Canadian adults surveyed knew about CWF. Of these, 80\% understood its intended use, approximately 60\% believed that it was both safe and effective, and 62\% supported the idea of having fluoride added to their local drinking water. Those with greater incomes [OR=1.4; p{$<$}0.001] and education [OR= 1.6; p{$<$}0.001] were more likely to know about CWF. Those with greater incomes [OR= 1.3; p{$<$}0.03] and those who visited the dentist more frequently [OR=1.8; p{$<$}0.002] were more likely to support CWF, and those with children [OR=0.5; p{$<$}0.02], those who accessed dental care using public insurance [OR=0.2; p{$<$}0.03], and those who avoided fluoride [OR=0.04; p{$<$}0.001] were less likely to support CWF. Conclusion: It appears that Canadians still support CWF. In moving forward, policy leaders will need to attend to two distinct challenges: the influence of anti-fluoride sentiment, and the potential risks created by avoiding fluoride. Contexte : La fluoration de l'eau dans les collectivit{\'e}s (FEC) fait actuellement face {\`a} une r{\'e}sistance sociale au Canada. Des p{\'e}titions ont {\'e}t{\'e} publiquement enregistr{\'e}es, des pl{\'e}biscites municipaux ont eu lieu et l'attention m{\'e}diatique concernant le sujet augmente. Les dirigeants se pr{\'e}occupent maintenant de la question pour savoir si la pratique est acceptable pour les Canadiens. Par cons{\'e}quent, cette {\'e}tude se penche sur la question suivante : quelles sont les diverses opinions publiques {\`a} propos de la FEC? M{\'e}thode : Des donn{\'e}es ont {\'e}t{\'e} recueillies en avril 2008 aupr{\`e}s de 1 005 adultes canadiens au moyen d'une {\'e}tude nationale par entrevue t{\'e}l{\'e}phonique utilisant la composition de num{\'e}ros au hasard et une technologie d'entrevues t{\'e}l{\'e}phoniques informatis{\'e}es. Des analyses de r{\'e}gression logistiques descriptives, bidimensionnelles et multidimensionnelles ont {\'e}t{\'e} entreprises. R{\'e}sultats : Environ 1 adulte canadien interrog{\'e} sur 2 avait entendu parler de la FEC. De ce nombre, 80 \% comprenaient son utilisation pr{\'e}vue, environ 60 \% croyaient qu'elle {\'e}tait {\`a} la foi s{\'e}curitaire et efficace, et 62 \% appuyaient l'id{\'e}e d'ajouter du fluorure {\`a} l'eau potable de leur localit{\'e}. Les personnes dont le revenu est plus {\'e}lev{\'e} [r.c.=1,4; p{$<$}0,001] et dont le niveau de scolarit{\'e} est plus {\'e}lev{\'e} [r.c.=1,6; p{$<$}0,001] {\'e}taient plus susceptibles d'avoir entendu parler de la FEC. Les personnes dont le revenu est plus {\'e}lev{\'e} [r.c.=1,3; p{$<$}0,03] et celles qui ont consult{\'e} un dentiste plus fr{\'e}quemment [r.c.=1,8; p{$<$}0,002] {\'e}taient plus susceptibles d'appuyer la FEC, celles ayant des enfants [r.c.=0,5; p{$<$}0,02], celles qui ont consult{\'e} le dentiste et b{\'e}n{\'e}ficiaient de l'assurance publique [r.c.=0,2; p{$<$}0,03], et celles qui {\'e}vitaient le fluorure [r.c.=0,04; p{$<$}0,001] {\'e}taient moins susceptibles d'appuyer la FEC. Conclusion : Il semble que les Canadiens appuient encore la FEC. En allant de l'avant, les dirigeants politiques devront relever deux d{\'e}fis distincts : l'influence de l'opinion allant contre la fluoration et les risques {\'e}ventuels de ne pas ajouter de fluorure {\`a} l'eau.]},

It demonstrates the enduring aversion to direct cost imposition as opposed to other policy options. This includes a brief period in late 2008 and early 2009 when prospects for direct cost imposition heightened markedly at the federal level but collapsed quickly in favor of a m{\'e}lange of other approaches that are likely to be less efficient but also less direct in their imposition of costs.

  abstract = {Concerns have been raised regarding the long-term impacts of early life exposure to the ubiquitous environmental contaminant bisphenol A (BPA) on brain organization. Because BPA has been reported to affect estrogen signaling, and steroid hormones play a critical role in brain sexual differentiation, there is also concern that BPA exposure could alter neural sex differences. Here, we examine the impact of subchronic exposure from gestation to adulthood to oral doses of BPA below the current no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) of 5 mg/kg body weight (bw)/day on estrogen receptor (ESR) expression in sexually dimorphic brain regions of prepubertal and adult female rats. The dams were gavaged daily with vehicle (0.3\% carboxymethylcellulose), 2.5, 25, 260, or 2700 {$\mu$}g BPA/kg bw/day, or 0.5 or 5.0 {$\mu$}g ethinyl estradiol (EE)/kg bw/day from gestational day 6 until labor began. Offspring were then gavaged directly from the day after birth until the day before scheduled sacrifice on postnatal days 21 or 90. Using in situ hybridization, one or more BPA doses produced significant decreases in Esr1 expression in the juvenile female rat anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV) of the hypothalamus and significant decreases in Esr2 expression in the adult female rat AVPV and medial preoptic area (MPOA), relative to vehicle controls. BPA did not simply reproduce EE effects, indicating that BPA is not acting solely as an estrogen mimic. The possible consequences of long-term changes in hypothalamic ESR expression resulting from subchronic low dose BPA exposure on neuroendocrine effects are discussed and being addressed in ongoing, related work.},

The linear dynamic range was 1.0 to 100 ng/ml and precision and accuracy over this range were within 15\%. Upon injection of reconstituted sample extracts into the hot injector port of the gas chromatograph, the benzyl alcohol metabolite undergoes a small amount of spontaneous dehydration to the alkene metabolite. We have incorporated an additional hexadeuterated internal standard of the benzyl alcohol into the assay to permit measurement of the extent of dehydration in each sample. This novel approach should be generally applicable to the simultaneous determination of benzyl alcohols and corresponding alkenes by GC-MS when the possibility exists that the alcohol can undergo spontaneous dehydration to the alkene in the injector port of GC instrumentation.

In general, ezlopitant is marked by high clearance values that approach or exceed hepatic blood flow values, moderate to high Values for steady-state volume of distribution (3.9-28 L/kg), and terminal phase half-life values ranging from 0.6 h in the guinea pig to 7.7 h in the rat. Oral bioavailability ranged from {$<$}0.2\% (guinea pig) to 28\% (dog). Data from portal vein cannulated dogs suggested that 37\% of an oral dose of ezlopitant enters the portal vein as an unchanged drug in this species. Ezlopitant is metabolized to two pharmacologically active metabolites, an alkene (CJ-12458) and a benzyl alcohol (CJ-12764). After administration of the parent compound, CJ-12764 was found in greater abundance than CJ-12458 in all species examined. Ezlopitant and CJ-12458 were highly protein bound in plasma (or serum), whereas the protein binding of CJ-12764 was somewhat lower. Measurement of the kinetics of ezlopitant, CJ-12458 and CJ-12764 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of dogs demonstrated that all three compounds can partition into the CSF, and thereby, be capable of contributing to centrally mediated pharmacological effects. Thus, these data suggest that the pharmacological activity exhibited by ezlopitant in preclinical species in vivo is likely a result of the parent compound plus the active metabolites. Furthermore, the contributions of ezlopitant and the active metabolites to pharmacological activity probably varies with the identity of the model species, as well as the dose and route of ezlopitant administration.

  abstract = {Some of the most pronounced ecological responses to climatic warming are expected to occur in polar marine regions, where temperature increases have been the greatest and sea ice provides a sensitive mechanism by which climatic conditions affect sympagic (i.e., with ice) species. Population-level effects of climatic change, however, remain difficult to quantify. We used a flexible extension of Cormack-Jolly-Seber capture-recapture models to estimate population size and survival for polar bears (Ursus maritimus), one of the most ice-dependent of Arctic marine mammals. We analyzed data for polar bears captured from 1984 to 2004 along the western coast of Hudson Bay and in the community of Churchill, Manitoba, Canada. The Western Hudson Bay polar bear population declined from 1,194 (95\% CI = 1,020-1,368) in 1987 to 935 (95\% CI = 794-1,076) in 2004. Total apparent survival of prime-adult polar bears (5--19 yr) was stable for females (0.93; 95\% CI = 0.91-0.94) and males (0.90; 95\% CI = 0.88-0.91). Survival of juvenile, subadult, and senescent-adult polar bears was correlated with spring sea ice breakup date, which was variable among years and occurred approximately 3 weeks earlier in 2004 than in 1984. We propose that this correlation provides evidence for a causal association between earlier sea ice breakup (due to climatic warming) and decreased polar bear survival. It may also explain why Churchill, like other communities along the western coast of Hudson Bay, has experienced an increase in human-polar bear interactions in recent years. Earlier sea ice breakup may have resulted in a larger number of nutritionally stressed polar bears, which are encroaching on human habitations in search of supplemental food. Because western Hudson Bay is near the southern limit of the species' range, our findings may foreshadow the demographic responses and management challenges that more northerly polar bear populations will experience if climatic warming in the Arctic continues as projected.},

In May 2008, the US Fish and Wildlife Service listed polar bears (Ursus maritimus) -- one of the most ice-dependent marine mammals -- as threatened under the US Endangered Species Act. 2. We evaluated the effects of sea ice conditions on vital rates (survival and breeding probabilities) for polar bears in the southern Beaufort Sea. Although sea ice declines in this and other regions of the polar basin have been among the greatest in the Arctic, to date population-level effects of sea ice loss on polar bears have only been identified in western Hudson Bay, near the southern limit of the species' range. 3. We estimated vital rates using multistate capture--recapture models that classified individuals by sex, age and reproductive category. We used multimodel inference to evaluate a range of statistical models, all of which were structurally based on the polar bear life cycle. We estimated parameters by model averaging, and developed a parametric bootstrap procedure to quantify parameter uncertainty. 4. In the most supported models, polar bear survival declined with an increasing number of days per year that waters over the continental shelf were ice free. In 2001--2003, the ice-free period was relatively short (mean 101 days) and adult female survival was high (0{$\cdot$}96--0{$\cdot$}99, depending on reproductive state). In 2004 and 2005, the ice-free period was longer (mean 135 days) and adult female survival was low (0{$\cdot$}73--0{$\cdot$}79, depending on reproductive state). Breeding rates and cub litter survival also declined with increasing duration of the ice-free period. Confidence intervals on vital rate estimates were wide. 5. The effects of sea ice loss on polar bears in the southern Beaufort Sea may apply to polar bear populations in other portions of the polar basin that have similar sea ice dynamics and have experienced similar, or more severe, sea ice declines. Our findings therefore are relevant to the extinction risk facing approximately one-third of the world's polar bears.},

Moreover, the concept has not been clearly differentiated from or systematically related to concepts addressing very similar phenomena ? tabloidization and ?infotainment?. Consequently, the results of various studies are hard to compare and different scientific discourses on related issues remain unconnected. Against this backdrop, this article offers a conceptual analysis of the concept based on studies in English and other languages. We identify key dimensions of the concept and make suggestions for a standardized definition and multi-dimensional measurement of harder and softer news. In doing so, we propose to distinguish thematic, focus and style features as basic dimensions that ? in their combination ? make up harder and softer types of news.},

  abstract = {It is by now well known that political attitudes can be affected by emotions. Most earlier studies have focused on emotions generated by some political event (e.g., terrorism or increased immigration). However, the methods used in previous efforts have made it difficult to untangle the various causal pathways that might link emotions to political beliefs. In contrast, we focus on emotions incidental (i.e., irrelevant) to the decision process, allowing us to cleanly trace and estimate the effect of experimentally induced anxiety on political beliefs. Further, we build upon innovative new work that links physiological reactivity (Hatemi, McDermott, Eaves, Kendler, \& Neale, 2013; Oxley et al., 2008a) to attitudes by using skin conductance reactivity as a measure of emotional arousal. We found that anxiety---generated by a video stimulus---significantly affected physiological arousal as measured by tonic skin-conductance levels, and that higher physiological reactivity predicted more anti-immigration attitudes. We show that physiological reactivity mediated the relationship between anxiety and political attitudes.},

As a result, many survey practitioners use straightlining as one, and sometimes the only, indicator of data quality. Respondents identified as straightliners are often removed from the data set on the assumption that their answers are meaningless. In this paper we show that these practices are based on a logical fallacy and demonstrate that in many common survey formats, the incidence of straightlining can be increased by improving the validity and the reliability of survey questions. We take initial steps in investigating the complexities and challenges of data analysis by providing a formal definition of valid straightlining and leverage that definition in a series of Monte Carlo simulations to better understand the conditions that give rise to valid straightlining. Although it remains for future work to distinguish valid from invalid straightliners, our formal definition of the concept and our simulation methods augment the tools survey analysts employ in assessing the prevalence of low effort respondents in survey data sets. The paper thereby takes initial steps toward sounder methods of classifying straightliners as optimizers or satisficers.},

  abstract = {Generative AI has prompted educators to reevaluate traditional teaching and assessment methods. This study examines AI's ability to write essays analysing Old English poetry; human markers assessed and attempted to distinguish them from authentic analyses of poetry by first-year undergraduate students in English at the University of Oxford. Using the standard UK University grading system, AI-written essays averaged a score of 60.46, whilst human essays achieved 63.57, a margin of difference not statistically significant (p = 0.10). Notably, student submissions applied a nuanced understanding of cultural context and secondary criticism to their close reading, while AI essays often described rather than analysed, lacking depth in the evaluation of poetic features, and sometimes failing to properly recognise key aspects of passages. Distinguishing features of human essays included detailed and sustained analysis of poetic style, as well as spelling errors and lack of structural cohesion. AI essays, on the other hand, exhibited a more formal structure and tone but sometimes fell short in incisive critique of poetic form and effect. Human markers correctly identified the origin of essays 79.41\% of the time. Additionally, we compare three purported AI detectors, finding that the best, `Quillbot', correctly identified the origin of essays 95.59\% of the time. However, given the high threshold for academic misconduct, conclusively determining origin remains challenging. The research also highlights the potential benefits of generative AI's ability to advise on structuring essays and suggesting avenues for research. We advocate for transparency regarding AI's capabilities and limitations, and this study underscores the importance of human critical engagement in teaching and learning in Higher Education. As AI's proficiency grows, educators must reevaluate what authentic assessment is, and consider implementing dynamic, holistic methods to ensure academic integrity.},

This is useful because these studies are often neglected in political philosophy literature. Section II has three stages. First, I sketch how the study results from section I question the practical viability of deliberative democracy. Second, I briefly present the results of three empirical studies of political deliberation that can be interpreted to counter the findings of the studies in section I.Third, I show why this is a misinterpretation and that the study results from section I mean that it is implausible that sites of political deliberation would naturally emerge from the wide public sphere and coalesce into institutionalized forms of the practice such that deliberative democracy can satisfy its raison d'{\^e}tre. Finally, in section III, I conclude that viable conceptions of deliberative democracy should be limited to narrower aims.},

However, little systematic research has been devoted to examining differences in how distinct negative emotions affect levels of populism among voters. This paper attempts to fill this gap by focusing on the influence of the two emotions most frequently connected to populism in political commentary: fear and anger. Informed by appraisal theories of emotions, we hypothesize that populist attitudes are driven by feelings of anger, rather than fear. Using a three-wave online panel survey of Spanish citizens between 2014 and 2016, we find that anger expressed over the economic crisis is consistently associated with variations in support for populism both between individuals and over time, whereas no significant effects emerge for expressions of fear. We discuss the implications of these findings for understanding the nature of populist support.},

We use a pre-registered study on a nationally representative sample of adult Canadians to explore the values-based correlates of NIMBYism and opposition to local housing development, as well as opposition to public policies designed to increase the housing stock. We also evaluate whether values moderate the relative importance of housing characteristics (e.g., build size, proximity, affordable vs. market-rate housing) on support for local development using a conjoint experiment. We find that nativism and traditionalism are generally associated with opposition to housing development, while free-market attitudes and egalitarianism are associated with support, but the latter two value dimensions differ in their support for policy depending on the role of the state. We also show that Canadians are less supportive of rental developments and those that feature larger build sizes (e.g., high rise apartments) and that are more proximate to their own homes, but are more supportive of affordable (vs. market-rate) housing. The latter finding is concentrated among those with low levels of traditionalism, nativism, free-market support, and high levels of egalitarianism. Taken together, our results suggest a complicated and nuanced relationship between core values and attitudes toward housing, but one thing is abundantly clear: values matter.},

  abstract = {Historically, the Supreme Court of Canada has avoided direct intervention in health care policy-making. This posture changed dramatically with the release of the Chaoulli decision in June 2005. In a narrow four-to-three decision, the Supreme Court struck down Quebec laws prohibiting the sale of private health insurance on the basis that they violate Quebec\&\#39;s Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms. Three of the four judges in the majority also found the provisions violate section seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. In a blistering dissent however, the three judges in the minority found that the insurance restriction violated neither the Quebec nor the Canadian charters. The result makes further Charter challenges to similar laws in other provinces inevitable, but the question of whether they will or should succeed remains contested. In September 2005, a conference was convened at the University of Toronto to discuss the legal implications of the Chaoulli decision. Some of the top Canadian scholars in the fields of health law and health policy were brought together to exchange ideas and to chart the potential legal course for Canada in the decision\&\#39;s wake. Access to Care, Access to Justice contains all the papers given at this conference. Edited by Colleen Flood, Lorne Sossin, and Kent Roach, the collection explores the role that courts may begin to play in health care and how this new role is of crucial importance to the Canadian public and their governments. As litigators for those who favour more freedom to provide private health care and aggrieved patients marshal their legal resources, provinces across the country are considering their options. Some are seeking guidance on how to better insulate themselves from review; others may welcome such challenges as a way to revisit the provisions of the Canada Health Act. The contributors to Access to Care, Access to Justice examine how the future of Canadian health care is likely to be determined both in the courts and in the legislatures and scrutinize how these changes will affect Canadians.},

Design/methodology/approach - The paper presents an analysis of advertising content against a framework of criteria drawn from key marketing concepts using examples from recent New Zealand general elections. Findings - There is a relationship between parties demonstrating a strong voter orientation in their political advertisements and achievement of electoral success. By viewing advertising as a symptom of parties' broader market orientation, the political marketing factors that differentiate the ``winner/s'' from the others in an election campaign may be uncovered. Research limitations/implications - The framework has only been applied to New Zealand Mixed Member Proportional (MMP) election campaigns. To make a more concrete connection between demonstration of market orientation and electoral success the framework needs to be tested in more than one electoral system, in more than one country. Practical implications - The paper reveals a useful way to relate political advertising content to electoral outcome. Originality/value - This framework has not been used before in the political advertising or political marketing fields. It strengthens the utility of political marketing explanations in relation to voter- and media-generated explanations of election outcomes.},

Policy researchers call this process "problem definition."  Written for both scholars and students, this book explains how and why social issues come to be defined in different ways, how these definitions are expressed in the world of politics, and what consequences these definitions have for government action and agenda-setting dynamics. The authors demonstrate in two theoretical chapters and seven provocative case studies how problem definition affects policymaking for high-profile social issues like AIDS, drugs, and sexual harassment as well as for problems like traffic congestion, plant closings, agricultural tax benefits, and air transportation.  By examining the way social problems are framed for political discussion, the authors illuminate the unique impact of beliefs, values, ideas, and language on the public policymaking process and its outcomes. In so doing, they establish a common vocabulary for the study of problem definition; review and critique the insights of existing work on the topic; and identify directions for future research.},

  abstract = {Successful wildlife management depends upon coordination and consultation with local communities. However, much of the research used to inform management is often derived solely from data collected directly from wildlife. Indigenous people living in the Arctic have a close connection to their environment, which provides unique opportunities to observe their environment and the ecology of Arctic species. Further, most northern Arctic communities occur within the range of polar bears (nanuq, Ursus maritimus) and have experienced significant climatic changes. Here, we used semi-structured interviews from 2017 to 2019 to document I{\~n}upiaq knowledge of polar bears observed over four decades in four Alaskan communities in the range of the Southern Beaufort Sea polar bear subpopulation: Wainwright, Utqia{\.g}vik, Nuiqsut, and Kaktovik. All but one of 47 participants described directional and notable changes in sea ice, including earlier ice breakup, later ice return, thinner ice, and less multiyear pack ice. These changes corresponded with observations of bears spending more time on land during the late summer and early fall in recent decades---observations consistent with scientific and Indigenous knowledge studies in Alaska, Canada, and Greenland. Participants noted that polar bear and seal body condition and local abundance either varied geographically or exhibited no patterns. However, participants described a recent phenomenon of bears being exhausted and lethargic when arriving on shore in the summer and fall after extensive swims from the pack ice. Further, several participants suggested that maternal denning is occurring more often on land than sea ice. Participants indicated that village and regional governments are increasingly challenged to obtain resources needed to keep their communities safe as polar bears spend more time on land, an issue that is likely to be exacerbated both in this region and elsewhere as sea ice loss continues. La gestion r{\'e}ussie de la faune d{\'e}pend des efforts de coordination et de consultation avec les collectivit{\'e}s locales. Toutefois, il arrive souvent qu'une grande partie de la recherche utilis{\'e}e pour {\'e}clairer la gestion d{\'e}rive uniquement des donn{\'e}es recueillies directement de la faune. Les peuples autochtones qui vivent dans l'Arctique entretiennent des liens {\'e}troits avec leur environnement, ce qui cr{\'e}e des occasions uniques d'observer l'environnement et l'{\'e}cologie des esp{\`e}ces de l'Arctique. Il y a {\'e}galement lieu de remarquer que la plupart des collectivit{\'e}s du nord de l'Arctique se trouvent dans l'aire de r{\'e}partition des ours polaires (nanuq, Ursus) et connaissent d'importants changements climatiques. Dans le cadre de cette {\'e}tude, nous nous sommes appuy{\'e}s sur des entrevues semi-structur{\'e}es r{\'e}alis{\'e}es entre 2017 et 2019 pour documenter les connaissances des I{\~n}upiaq au sujet des ours polaires d{\'e}coulant d'observations {\'e}chelonn{\'e}es sur quatre d{\'e}cennies dans quatre collectivit{\'e}s de l'Alaska situ{\'e}es dans l'aire de r{\'e}partition de la sous-population d'ours polaires du sud de la mer de Beaufort : Wainwright, Utqia{\.g}vik, Nuiqsut et Kaktovik. Les 47 participants, sauf un, ont d{\'e}crit des changements directionnels et remarquables en ce qui a trait {\`a} la glace de mer, dont des d{\'e}b{\^a}cles plus h{\^a}tives, le retour plus tardif de la glace, de la glace plus mince et moins de banquises pluriannuelles. Ces changements correspondent aux observations d'ours qui passent plus de temps sur la terre ferme en fin d'{\'e}t{\'e} et en d{\'e}but d'automne au cours des derni{\`e}res d{\'e}cennies. Ces observations co{\"i}ncident avec les {\'e}tudes sur les connaissances scientifiques et autochtones r{\'e}alis{\'e}es en Alaska, au Canada et au Groenland. Les participants ont fait remarquer que la condition corporelle des ours polaires et des phoques ainsi que leur abondance {\`a} l'{\'e}chelle locale variaient d'une r{\'e}gion {\`a} l'autre ou n'affichaient aucune tendance. Cependant, les participants ont d{\'e}crit un ph{\'e}nom{\`e}ne r{\'e}cent selon lequel les ours sont {\'e}puis{\'e}s et l{\'e}thargiques lorsqu'ils arrivent sur la rive {\`a} l'{\'e}t{\'e} et {\`a} l'automne, apr{\`e}s avoir parcouru de longues distances {\`a} la nage depuis les banquises. Aussi, plusieurs participants ont laiss{\'e} entendre que les aires de mise bas se retrouvent plus souvent sur la terre ferme que sur la glace de mer. Les participants ont indiqu{\'e} que le gouvernement des villages et les gouvernements r{\'e}gionaux ont de plus en plus de difficult{\'e} {\`a} obtenir les ressources n{\'e}cessaires pour assurer la s{\'e}curit{\'e} de leurs collectivit{\'e}s, car les ours polaires passent plus de temps sur la terre ferme, un enjeu qui risque de s'aggraver, tant dans cette r{\'e}gion qu'ailleurs, {\`a} mesure que la glace de mer continuera de perdre de l'ampleur.},

Declines in size and condition have provided early indicators of population decline in polar bears (Ursus maritimus) near the southern extreme of their range. We tested whether patterns in body size, condition, and cub recruitment of polar bears in the southern Beaufort Sea of Alaska were related to the availability of preferred sea ice habitats and whether these measures and habitat availability exhibited trends over time, between 1982 and 2006. The mean skull size and body length of all polar bears over three years of age declined over time, corresponding with long-term declines in the spatial and temporal availability of sea ice habitat. Body size of young, growing bears declined over time and was smaller after years when sea ice availability was reduced. Reduced litter mass and numbers of yearlings per female following years with lower availability of optimal sea ice habitat, suggest reduced reproductive output and juvenile survival. These results, based on analysis of a long-term data set, suggest that declining sea ice is associated with nutritional limitations that reduced body size and reproduction in this population.},

Such innovations are initially perceived as uncertain and even risky. To overcome this uncertainty, most people seek out others like themselves who have already adopted the new idea. Thus the diffusion process consists of a few individuals who first adopt an innovation, then spread the word among their circle of acquaintances---a process which typically takes months or years. But there are exceptions: use of the Internet in the 1990s, for example, may have spread more rapidly than any other innovation in the history of humankind. Furthermore, the Internet is changing the very nature of diffusion by decreasing the importance of physical distance between people. The fifth edition addresses the spread of the Internet, and how it has transformed the way human beings communicate and adopt new ideas.},

  abstract = {In view of the robust link often inferred between autonomous journalism and the strength of a society's democratic institutions, and against the background of current challenges to journalists' traditional roles as purveyors of timely and independent information, we interviewed 352 Canadian journalists about their social and political roles and the influences on their news choices. Comparison of their responses against an international data set (N = 27,567) suggests that Canadian journalists place greater value on detached monitorial roles and claim relatively greater autonomy from commercial and other influences on their work. Further, in comparing these findings to an influential panel study from 1996 to 2003, we conclude that the Canadian journalists' ``credo,'' focused on neutral reporting and oriented more to perceived public interest than to business or audience interests, remains surprisingly intact despite contemporary pressures on news forms and business models. This professed neutrality is mitigated by a desire to promote diversity and tolerance., Compte tenu du lien solide souvent inf{\'e}r{\'e} entre le journalisme autonome et la force des institutions d{\'e}mocratiques d'une soci{\'e}t{\'e}, et dans le contexte actuel de remise en question des r{\^o}les traditionnels des journalistes en tant que fournisseurs d'information opportune et ind{\'e}pendante, nous avons interview{\'e} 352 journalistes canadiens sur leur r{\^o}le social et politique et les influences qu'ils exercent sur leurs choix de nouvelles. La comparaison de leurs r{\'e}ponses avec un ensemble de donn{\'e}es internationales (N = 27 567) sugg{\`e}re que les journalistes canadiens accordent plus d'importance aux r{\^o}les de << surveillance d{\'e}tach{\'e}s >> et revendiquent une autonomie relative par rapport aux influences commerciales et autres sur leur travail.

In a novel attempt to address this issue, we designed a psychological intervention in the form of an online browser game. In the game, players take on the role of a fake news producer and learn to master six documented techniques commonly used in the production of misinformation: polarisation, invoking emotions, spreading conspiracy theories, trolling people online, deflecting blame, and impersonating fake accounts. The game draws on an inoculation metaphor, where preemptively exposing, warning, and familiarising people with the strategies used in the production of fake news helps confer cognitive immunity when exposed to real misinformation. We conducted a large-scale evaluation of the game with N\,=\,15,000 participants in a pre-post gameplay design. We provide initial evidence that people's ability to spot and resist misinformation improves after gameplay, irrespective of education, age, political ideology, and cognitive style.},

Their governing and electoral functions are among the chief concerns of the field. Yet most political theorists--including democratic theorists--ignore or disparage parties as grubby arenas of ambition, obstacles to meaningful political participation and deliberation. On the Side of the Angels is a vigorous defense of the virtues of parties and partisanship, and their worth as a subject for political theory. Nancy Rosenblum's account moves between political theory and political science, and she uses resources from both fields to outline an appreciation of parties and the moral distinctiveness of partisanship. She draws from the history of political thought and identifies the main lines of opposition to parties, as well as the rare but significant moments of appreciation. Rosenblum then sets forth her own theoretical appreciation of parties and partisanship. She discusses the achievement of parties in regulating rivalries, channeling political energies, and creating the lines of division that make pluralist politics meaningful. She defends "partisan" as a political identity over the much-vaunted status of "independent," and she considers where contemporary democracies should draw the line in banning parties. On the Side of the Angels offers an ethics of partisanship that speaks to questions of centrism, extremism, and polarization in American party politics. By rescuing parties from their status as orphans of political philosophy, Rosenblum fills a significant void in political and democratic theory.},

Again contrary to conventional wisdom, it is argued that such interagency tensions may fulfill various positive functions: they put crisis agencies to the test; they serve to counteract `groupthink tendencies; they foster a certain degree of openness; and they may facilitate democratic control of far-reaching crisis management policies.},

Methods Employing data from the 2008 American National Election Study (ANES), we conduct a logit analysis to estimate the effects of theoretically relevant factors on immigration attitudes. Results Our findings indicate that even in the face of poor economic conditions that disproportionately impacted Millennials, this cohort's attitudes toward immigration are quite resilient. While Millennials' immigration attitudes vary across a number of determinants, overall, they are more tolerant of immigration than non-Millennials. Conclusion Millennials' tolerance of immigration is consistent with their general liberal beliefs. This is true even under the conditional impact of economic self-interest and the conditional and prevalence impact of culture during the recession---a time when Millennials could have been susceptible to factors mitigating their feelings toward immigrants.},

The hypothesis statements are tested using data from the SSHRC-funded Canadian Provincial Election Project (CPEP) Survey, conducted post-provincial election in 2011-2012 in eight provinces. The paper concludes that while there were diverging orientations amongst employees in the three sectors, there were also some areas of convergence to suggest that there may be substantial diversity within each sector.},

The dialogue has extended to the peer-reviewed literature, scientific conferences, the mass media, government advisory bodies, and beyond. Whereas biases can come from myriad sources, the overwhelming focus of the discussion to date has been on industry-funded science. Given the critical role that industry has played and will continue to play in the research process, the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) North America Working Group on Guiding Principles has, in this article, proposed conflict-of-interest guidelines regarding industry funding to protect the integrity and credibility of the scientific record, particularly with respect to health, nutrition, and food-safety science. Eight principles are enumerated, which specify the ground rules for industry-sponsored research. This article, which issues a challenge to the broader scientific community to address all bias issues, is only a first step; the document is intended to be dynamic, prompting ongoing discussion and refinement. In the conduct of public/private research relationships, all relevant parties shall 1) conduct or sponsor research that is factual, transparent, and designed objectively, and, according to accepted principles of scientific inquiry, the research design will generate an appropriately phrased hypothesis and the research will answer the appropriate questions, rather than favor a particular outcome; 2) require control of both study design and research itself to remain with scientific investigators; 3) not offer or accept remuneration geared to the outcome of a research project; 4) ensure, before the commencement of studies, that there is a written agreement that the investigative team has the freedom and obligation to attempt to publish the findings within some specified time frame; 5) require, in publications and conference presentations, full signed disclosure of all financial interests; 6) not participate in undisclosed paid authorship arrangements in industry-sponsored publications or presentations; 7) guarantee accessibility to all data and control of statistical analysis by investigators and appropriate auditors/reviewers; 8) require that academic researchers, when they work in contract research organizations (CRO) or act as contract researchers, make clear statements of their affiliation; and require that such researchers publish only under the auspices of the CRO.},

Folk economic notions evolved in our ancestors in circumstances where there was little in the way of specialization, division of labor, capital investment, or economic growth. It can explain the beliefs of na{\"i}ve individuals regarding matters such as international trade, labor economics, law and economics, and industrial organization. It is important that voters understand economic principles. Economists would do a better job of persuading others and of teaching if we paid explicit attention to folk economics. Because untrained individuals do not fully understand gains from trade, training in economics is likely to improve welfare by increasing the number of trading opportunities. There is evidence that this is in fact true.},

But, as David Runciman suggests, it is actually much more cynical to pretend that politics can ever be completely sincere. Political Hypocrisy is a timely, and timeless, book on the problems of sincerity and truth in politics, and how we can deal with them without slipping into hypocrisy ourselves. Runciman draws on the work of some of the great truth-tellers in modern political thought--Hobbes, Mandeville, Jefferson, Bentham, Sidgwick, and Orwell--and applies his ideas to different kinds of hypocritical politicians from Oliver Cromwell to Hillary Clinton. He argues that we should accept hypocrisy as a fact of politics--the most dangerous form of political hypocrisy is to claim to have a politics without hypocrisy. Featuring a new foreword that takes the story up to Donald Trump, this book examines why, instead of vainly searching for authentic politicians, we should try to distinguish between harmless and harmful hypocrisies and worry only about the most damaging varieties.},

Bush. This book is the first attempt to fulfill that wish, using the long history of the modern state to put the events of recent years--the war on terror, the war in Iraq, the falling out between Europe and the United States--in their proper perspective. It also dissects the way that politicians like Blair and Bush have used and abused history to justify the new world order they are creating. Many books about international politics since 9/11 contend that either everything changed or nothing changed on that fateful day. This book identifies what is new about contemporary politics but also how what is new has been exploited in ways that are all too familiar. It compares recent political events with other crises in the history of modern politics--political and intellectual, ranging from seventeenth-century England to Weimar Germany--to argue that the risks of the present crisis have been exaggerated, manipulated, and misunderstood. David Runciman argues that there are three kinds of time at work in contemporary politics: news time, election time, and historical time. It is all too easy to get caught up in news time and election time, he writes. This book is about viewing the threats and challenges we face in real historical time.},

This paper will further examine the fact that, not only does this divergence in approaches exist, it permeates as a precedent through succeeding Court decisions and, in turn, hinders the ability of indigenous communities and indigenous rights to move forward and progress into the 21st century.},

  abstract = {Humans and wildlife are exposed to numerous anthropogenic drugs and pollutants. Many of these compounds are hormonally active, and recent evidence suggests that the presence of these endocrine disruptors permanently alters normal development and physiology in a variety of vertebrate species. Here, we report on the effects of developmental exposure to two common estrogenic pollutants, bisphenol A and ethinyl estradiol on sexually dimorphic, non-reproductive behavior. Mice (Mus musculus domesticus) were exposed to environmentally relevant levels of these chemicals (2 and 200 microg/kg/day for bisphenol A and 5 microg/kg/day for ethinyl estradiol) throughout prenatal and early postnatal development. As adults, the animals were observed in a variety of tests measuring sexually dimorphic behaviors including short-term spatial memory (in a radial-arm maze and a Barnes maze) and anxiety (in an elevated-plus maze and a light/dark preference chamber). Developmental exposure to ethinyl estradiol was found to masculinize behavior in all of the assays used. Bisphenol A increased anxious behavior in a dose-dependent fashion but had no effect on spatial memory. These results indicate that non-reproductive, sexually dimorphic behavior is sensitive to endocrine disruption. In addition, these experiments suggest that both humans and wildlife are being exposed to levels of these endocrine disrupting compounds that are sufficient to disrupt the development of the nervous system and that may have permanent consequences on sexually dimorphic behaviors.}

It has been suggested that exposure to even low doses of BPA during development may be associated with increased susceptibility to obesity and diabetes later in life. Despite growing public concern, the existing empirical data are equivocal, prompting The Endocrine Society, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and others to call for further research. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that perinatal exposure to an ecologically relevant dose of BPA (1 part per billion via the diet) results in increased susceptibility to high-fat diet-induced obesity and glucose intolerance in adult CD-1 mice. The data did not support this hypothesis. In agreement with previous reports, we find that weanling mice exposed to BPA during gestation and lactation are heavier compared with control mice. We also find that BPA mice are longer than controls at 4 wk of age, but these differences are no longer apparent when the mice reach adulthood, even when tested on a high-fat diet. We conclude that this larger size-for-age represents a faster rate of growth early in development rather than an obese, diabetic phenotype in adulthood.},

A total of 286 subjects were randomly assigned to moderate-intensity exercise (approximately 60\% maximal oxygen uptake (VO(2max)); group 1, n=143) and high-intensity exercise (approximately 80\% VO(2max); group 2, n=143) groups. The two groups exercised for 60 weeks in five sessions per week, each session lasting 120 min. This was followed by a 36-week low-intensity exercise recovery period. All subjects underwent routine semen analysis. Blood samples were drawn for the determination of the levels of the following hormones: LH, FSH, prolactin, testosterone (T), free testosterone (fT), inhibin B, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). The HPT axis was assessed using GnRH and human chorionic gonadotropin tests. After 24 weeks of exercise, the subjects exercising with high intensity demonstrated significantly declined semen parameters compared with those exercising with moderate intensity (P=0.03). Serum T and fT began to decrease, and serum SHBG began to increase at the end of 12 weeks with both moderate- and high-intensity exercises. The serum LH and FSH concentrations decreased below the baseline level at 12 weeks in both groups (P=0.07 in group 1 and 0.03 in group 2). Both groups had blunted LH and FSH responses to GnRH. These parameters improved to their pre-exercise level during the recovery period. Long-term strenuous treadmill exercises (overtraining syndrome) have a deleterious effect on reproduction.},

  abstract = {The rise of the radical populist right has been linked to fundamental socioeconomic changes fueled by globalization and economic deregulation. Yet, socioeconomic factors can hardly fully explain the rise of the new right. We suggest that emotional processes that affect people?s identities provide an additional explanation for the current popularity of the new radical right, not only among low- and medium-skilled workers, but also among the middle classes whose insecurities manifest as fears of not being able to live up to salient social identities and their constitutive values, and as shame about this actual or anticipated inability. This link between fear and shame is particularly salient in contemporary capitalist societies where responsibility for success and failure is increasingly individualized, and failure is stigmatized through unemployment, receiving welfare benefits, or labor migration. Under these conditions, we identify two psychological mechanisms behind the rise of the new populist right. The first mechanism of ressentiment explains how negative emotions ? fear and insecurity, in particular ? transform through repressed shame into anger, resentment and hatred towards perceived ?enemies? of the self and associated social groups, such as refugees, immigrants, the long-term unemployed, political and cultural elites, and the ?mainstream? media. The second mechanism relates to the emotional distancing from social identities that inflict shame and other negative emotions, and instead promotes seeking meaning and self-esteem from aspects of identity perceived to be stable and to some extent exclusive, such as nationality, ethnicity, religion, language and traditional gender roles.},

  abstract = {The present crisis of science's governance, affecting science's reproducibility, scientific peer review and science's integrity, offers a chance to reconsider evidence based policy as it is being practiced at present. Current evidence based policy exercises entail forms of quantification -- often in the form of risk analysis or cost benefit analyses -- which aim to optimize one among a set of policy options corresponding to a generally single framing of the issue under consideration. More cogently the deepening of the analysis corresponding to a single view of what the problem is has the effect of distracting from what could be alternative readings. When using evidence based policy those alternative frames become a kind of `uncomfortable knowledge' which is de facto removed from the policy discourse. All the more so when the analysis is supported by extensive mathematical modelling. Thus evidence based policy may result in a dramatic simplification of the available perceptions, in flawed policy prescriptions and in the neglect of other relevant world views of legitimate stakeholders. This use of scientific method ultimately generates -- rather than resolving -- controversies and erodes the institutional trust of the involved actors. We suggest an alternative approach -- which we term quantitative story-telling -- which encourages a major effort in the pre-analytic, pre-quantitative phase of the analysis as to map a socially robust universe of possible frames, which represent different lenses through which to perceive what the problem is. This is followed by an analysis where the emphasis in not on confirmatory checks or system optimization but -- the opposite -- on an attempt to refute the frames if these violate constraints of feasibility (compatibility with processes outside human control); viability (compatibility with processes under human control), and desirability (compatibility with a plurality of normative considerations relevant to the system's actors).},

Our paper answers this question with a large-scale, longitudinal analysis of how The Globe and Mail, Canada's leading national newspaper, covered 13 Canadian party leadership contests held between 1975 and 2012. We analyzed changes in the amount and style of reporting over the course of this 37-year time period, finding that the Globe has provided less coverage of party leadership competitions overall. The diminishing number of stories printed on the subject increasingly feature opinion writing, photos, combative language and the elevation of the individual candidate over the party organization. Our findings support a key element of the mediatization thesis: the shift from political logic to media logic as an organizing principle for political communications.},

Although the rationalist assumptions of evidence-based policy making have been subject to severe challenge from constructivist and post-modernist perspectives, it is argued that the attempt to ground policy making in more reliable knowledge of `what works' retains its relevance and importance. Indeed, its importance is enhanced by the need for effective governance of complex social systems and it is argued that `reflexive social learning' informed by policy and programme evaluation constitutes an increasingly important basis for `interactive governance'. The expanded use of piloting of new policies and programmes by the current UK Government is considered to provide limited scope for evaluation to derive reliable evidence of whether policies work. There is a need for greater clarity about the role of evaluation in situations where piloting essentially constitutes `prototyping'. More emphasis should be placed on developing a sound evidence base for policy through long-term impact evaluations of policies and programmes. It is argued from a realist position that such evaluation should be theory-based and focused on explaining and understanding how policies achieve their effects using `multi-method' approaches.},

  abstract = {Public perceptions of science and scientific institutions have become more negative in recent years, especially among individuals who identify as ideologically conservative in the United States. While there is much work investigating the origins and implications of this decline, we focus instead on understanding the ways in which symbols of scientific expertise, like the university, convey information in a politicized environment. Universities are seen as trusted scientific experts or biased propagandists, depending on individuals' ideological identification. Are individuals more likely to believe research coming out of universities that they perceive to reflect their own ideological biases? This project looks at the effect of the academic source cue -- the university label -- on individual assessments of the research that these universities produce. Drawing on results from two survey experiments focused on climate change and racial wealth disparity research, we find that while liberals are more likely to believe research that confirms their previously held beliefs, they are also more likely to believe incongruent information when it comes from a university that they believe shares their bias. Conservatives, on the other hand, remain skeptical of academic research despite the message or its' source. The findings point toward both ``blind trust'' and ``blind skepticism'' in academic institutions.},

Then, drawing from examples such as climate change, genetically modified foods, and nuclear waste disposal, I explore the idea that scientific inquiry is inherently and unavoidably subject to becoming politicized in environmental controversies. I discuss three reasons for this. First, science supplies contesting parties with their own bodies of relevant, legitimated facts about nature, chosen in part because they help make sense of, and are made sensible by, particular interests and normative frameworks. Second, competing disciplinary approaches to understanding the scientific bases of an environmental controversy may be causally tied to competing value-based political or ethical positions. The necessity of looking at nature through a variety of disciplinary lenses brings with it a variety of normative lenses, as well. Third, it follows from the foregoing that scientific uncertainty, which so often occupies a central place in environmental controversies, can be understood not as a lack of scientific understanding but as the lack of coherence among competing scientific understandings, amplified by the various political, cultural, and institutional contexts within which science is carried out. In light of these observations, I briefly explore the problem of why some types of political controversies become ``scientized'' and others do not, and conclude that the value bases of disputes underlying environmental controversies must be fully articulated and adjudicated through political means before science can play an effective role in resolving environmental problems.},

Specifically, it argues that political divisions within the labour movement and the New Democratic Party (NDP) convinced the leadership ofthe Canadian Labour Congress (CLC) to exclude itselffromthe process ofpatriating the Constitution. Several scholars have previously argued that the CLC was either unaware of or genuinely disinterested in constitutional issues. However, primary sources strongly indicate that these explanations are simply insufficient. Although it is accurate to suggest that the CLC was not an active participant in the process of constitutional reform, inactivity should not be confused with disinterest. The Congress made a strategic political decision to exclude itselffromthe patriation debate in order to avoid an internal battle between its allies in the NDP and its affiliate, the Qu{\'e}bec Federation ofLabour.},

The argument is premised on the notion that liberal human rights discourse does little to address the inequalities in wealth and power that polarize Canadian society along class lines.},

Much of this literature is grounded in management marketing theory, and the contention of this article is that while this may provide a useful heuristic device, the models of political behaviour it proposes are seriously flawed by their assumptions of a passive or neutral role for the media. The intention here is, first, to restore agency to the media. This is achieved by highlighting their influence in shaping the political message, rather than simply disseminating it as implied by the management marketing models. Second, we draw attention to some of the key democratic implications of applying marketing to the practice of politics and highlight the potential role of the media as agents providing a corrective function to the democratic deficits we identify.},

In the late 1990s, political power is in the hands of the prime minister and a small group of carefully selected courtiers rather than with the prime minister acting in concert with his elected cabinet colleagues. The article reviews the forces that have led to the rise of court government and the policy instruments and administrative tools that enable it to function. National unity concerns, the role of the media and lobbyists, as well as reforms at the centre of government and globalization, have all served to reshape how policy and decisions are made in the government of Canada. The changes hold important implications, not just for cabinet government, but also for the public service and Canadians themselves., L'article remet en question des ide{\'e}es accept{\'e}es de longue date sur le fonctionnement du gouvemement f{\'e}d{\'e}ral canadien.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT:  Background: The United Nations states that "prisoners should enjoy the same standards of health care that are available in the community." However, persons in custody continue to face barriers to care worldwide. The health of persons in federal custody in Canada is governed by the Corrections and Conditional Release Act (CCRA), which states that Correctional Services Canada is responsible for the provision of "essential health care" to all inmates. In the absence of concrete definition, these "essential" services provided in Canadian federal prisons often fall below standard. More research is needed into how "health care" is represented as a problem in Canada's federal prisons, and the impact on the incarcerated population.     Methodology: Carol Bacchi's "What's the Problem Represented to Be?" (WPR) (Bacchi, 2009) framework was applied to the CCRA with a specific focus on health care. Questions one, three, and five of the WPR approach were applied, respectively, in order to analyze how the "problem" of "health care" is represented, how this particular representation came about, and the effects of this representation on the health of persons in custody.    Findings: In applying the WPR approach to the CCRA, three main themes emerged. First, the notion of what services are constituted as "essential" in the context of federal prisons is more limited compared to the broader community. Second, the creation of the CCRA involved a great deal of discussion around the rights of persons in custody versus the protection of society, a dichotomy that has significant bearings on the treatment of those in prison. Third, this representation has negative effects on the health of those in custody.    Conclusion: The representation of health care in the CCRA has negative effects on the health of persons in custody. Greater attention must be paid to these inequities in health care provision in order to meet UN standards.     Keywords: Prison Health, Essential Health Care, Carol Bacchi, Inequity},

It tends to treat advertising as a core, and often debased, resource for deliberation. However, advertising as a form is less suited to complex information and more to engagement of interest. Despite this, political advertising normally is both constructed and analysed as information carriers. While commercial advertising attracts interest through pleasure and popular discourse, political advertising remains wedded to information. The persuasive strategies of political and commercial advertising are marked as much by dissimilarity as by similarity, the former aiming at plausibility and the latter at pleasure. The article analyses party election broadcasts in the UK over two general elections, according to a scheme that elicits both the informational content and its aesthetic and emotional appeals. Both the analysis design and the underlying rationale may have application beyond the UK. They help answer the quuestion: why does political advertising seem so dull and so bad to so many people?},

If market research, spin, and advertising were the key signifiers of marketed par-ties and candidates in the 1980s and 1990s, ``branding'' is the hallmark now. It will argue that the brand concept has analytical value. It is not simply a convenient and fashionable term for image.

  abstract = {Political party organizations play large roles in democracies, yet their organizations differ widely, and their statutes change much more frequently than constitutions or electoral laws. How do these differences, and these frequent changes, affect the operation of democracy?  This book seeks to answer these questions by presenting a comprehensive overview of the state of party organization in nineteen contemporary democracies. Using a unique new data collection, the book's chapters test propositions about the reasons for variation and similarities across party organizations. They find more evidence of within-country similarity than of cross-national patterns based on party ideology. After exploring parties' organizational differences, the remaining chapters investigate the impact of these differences. The volume considers a wide range of theories about how party organization may affect political life, including the impact of party rules on the selection of female candidates, the links between party decision processes and the stability of party programmes, the connection between party finance sources and public trust in political parties, and whether the strength of parties' extra-parliamentary organization affects the behaviour of their elected legislators. Collectively these chapters help to advance comparative studies of elections and representation by inserting party institutions and party agency more firmly into the centre of such studies.  Comparative Politics is a series for researchers, teachers, and students of political science that deals with contemporary government and politics. Global in scope, books in the series are characterised by a stress on comparative analysis and strong methodological rigour. The series is published in association with the European Consortium for Political Research. For more information visit: www.ecprnet.eu.

The analysis focuses on policy tools or instruments and the underlying behavioral assumptions that guide their choice. We begin with the premise that public policy almost always attempts to get people to do things they otherwise would not have done, or it enables them to do things they might not have done otherwise. Policy tools are used to overcome impediments to policy-relevant actions. The five broad categories of tools we identify--authority, incentives, capacity-building, symbolic and hortatory, and learning--make different assumptions about how policy relevant behavior can be fostered.

Analysis of data from the National Survey of Families and Households and the 2003--7 waves of the American Time Use Survey shows that men who do ``women's work'' in the market spend more time on male-typed housework relative to men in gender-balanced occupations and their wives spend more time on female-typed housework. Women in gender-atypical occupations also do more female-typed housework than women in gender-balanced occupations. The article provides clearer evidence about the important ways in which cultural conceptions of gender shape and are shaped by economic processes.}

The theory contends that social constructions influence the policy agenda and the selection of policy tools, as well as the rationales that legitimate policy choices. Constructions become embedded in policy as messages that are absorbed by citizens and affect their orientations and participation. The theory is important because it helps explain why some groups are advantaged more than others independently of traditional notions of political power and how policy designs reinforce or alter such advantages. An understanding of social constructions of target populations augments conventional hypotheses about the dynamics of policy change, the determination of beneficiaries and losers, the reasons for differing levels and types of participation among target groups, and the role of policy in democracy.}

Bisphenol A (BPA), which is employed in the manufacture of a wide range of consumer products, is a prime candidate for endocrine disruption. We examined BPA to address the question of whether in utero exposure affects the uterus of the offspring and studied the expression and distribution of the estrogen receptors alpha (ERalpha) and beta (ERbeta), because estrogens influence the development, growth, and function of the uterus through both receptors. Gravid Sprague-Dawley dams were administered by gavage either 0.1 or 50 mg/kg per day BPA or 0.2 mg/kg per day 17alpha-ethinyl estradiol (EE2) as reference dose on gestation days 6 through 21. Female offspring were killed in estrus. Uterine morphologic changes as well as ERalpha and ERbeta distribution and expression were measured by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. Striking morphologic changes were observed in the uterine epithelium of postpubertal offspring during estrus of the in utero BPA-treated animals (the thickness of the total epithelium was significantly reduced). ERalpha expression was increased in the 50-mg BPA and EE2-treated group. In contrast, we observed significantly decreased ERbeta expression in all BPA- and EE2-treated animals when compared with the control. In summary, these results clearly indicate that in utero exposure of rats to BPA promotes uterine disruption in offspring. We hypothesize that the uterine disruption could possibly be provoked by a dysregulation of ERalpha and ERbeta.}

  abstract = {Canada is often called a pluralist state, but few commentators view Aboriginal self-government from the perspective of political pluralism. Instead, Aboriginal identity is framed in terms of cultural and national traits, while self-government is taken to represent an Aboriginal desire to protect those traits. Shifting Boundaries challenges this view, arguing that it fosters a woefully incomplete understanding of the politics of self-government. Taking the position that a relational theory of pluralism offers a more accurate interpretation, Tim Schouls contends that self-government is better understood when an "identification" perspective on Aboriginal identity is adopted instead of a "cultural" or "national" one. He shows that self-government is not about preserving cultural and national differences as goods in and of themselves, but rather is about equalizing current imbalances in power to allow Aboriginal peoples to construct their own identities. In focusing on relational pluralism, Shifting Boundaries adds an important perspective to existing theoretical approaches to Aboriginal self-government. It will appeal to academics, students, and policy analysts interested in Aboriginal governance, cultural studies, political theory, nationalism studies, and constitutional theory.},

Progressive reforms around the turn of the century reduced the power of parties and increased the role of education, making way for the "informed citizen," which remains the ideal in American civic life. Today a fourth model, "the rights-bearing citizen," supplements the "informed citizen" model and makes the courthouse as well as the voting booth a channel for citizenship.},

While Carey's initial writing on the Lippmann-Dewey exchange was insightful, by 1987, his characterization of the exchange seriously misreads Lippmann, and misdirects a decade of discussion. Comparing Carey's remarks about Lippmann, and similar remarks from other leading scholars influenced by Carey's reading, with what Lippmann actually said, reveals that Lippmann's elitism did not make him anti-democratic but, instead, a subtle thinker concerned with how to integrate expertise into a functioning democracy. This article speculates why Carey misinterpreted Lippmann's work, and concludes with what remains relevant in Carey's argument.},

This question has attracted the interest of many journalism historians but it has not previously been examined as an instance of a more general social phenomenon, the emergence of new cultural norms and ideals. Four conditions for the emergence of new norms are identified ? two having to do with the self-conscious pursuit of internal group solidarity; and two having to do with the need to articulate the ideals of social practice in a group in order to exercise control over subordinates and to pass on group culture to the next generation. Reviewing the history of the professionalization of American journalism, this essay identifies the late 19th and early 20th century as the period when these conditions crystallized. Alternative technological and economic explanations of the emergence of objectivity are criticized and the difficulty of understanding why objectivity as a norm emerged first and most fully in the United States rather than in European journalism is discussed.},

Should experts have a role in governing democracies? Is news melodramatic or is it ironic -- or is it both at different times? In the title essay, Schudson even suggests that journalism serves the interests of free expression and democracy best when it least lives up to the demands of media critics for deep thought and analysis; passion for the sensational event may be news at its democratically most powerful.

This article argues that the electoral success of this political challenger, however, is rooted in more than the upsurge of populist resentments born out of these crises. Integrating theories about the activation of attitudes with arguments about the effects of exposure to local political contexts, I contend that the electoral success of the AfD reflects the mobilization of deep-seated nativist sentiments. To test these propositions, I draw on a large panel dataset of the AfD's electoral returns at the municipal level (N = 10,694) which I link to pre-crises data on the marginal success of extreme-right parties. Exploiting variation between municipalities located within the same county (N = 294), I estimate a series of spatial simultaneous autoregressive error models by maximum likelihood estimation. The results show that the success of the AfD is rooted in the local prevalence of nativist sentiments that date prior to the crises that fomented the formation of the challenger party--an effect that becomes stronger in the course of the radicalization of the AfD. I further demonstrate that the populist right AfD is best able to broaden its electoral appeal among local communities with an extreme-right sub-culture, particularly in Eastern Germany. This suggests that even small extreme-right networks can act as a breeding ground for the populist right and help spread xenophobic and nativist sentiments among citizens.},

  abstract = {Is New Zealand a model for "reinventing" government and cutting spending? The government of Alberta, Canada, consciously replicated significant elements of the New Zealand model to attain fiscal balance and public sector reorganization, including the core element of restructuring institutions to change individual behavior. Despite broad similarities in policy content and outcome, differences in the specific content of policy and the politics of policy implementation led to differences in the sustainability of reform and the location of budget cuts. Alberta's Progressive Conservative party emphasized expenditure cuts where both the New Zealand Labour and National parties emphasized government reorganization and the introduction of market mechanisms. Contrasting these efforts to balance budgets and reinvent government suggests that there is considerable variation in the "model," and that left governments in general are probably more likely to pursue and succeed at the reinvention of government, while stinting fiscal balance. Right governments, on the other hand, are more likely to achieve short-run fiscal balance at the expense of successful reinvention. In turn this suggests that while the partisan orientation of the reforming party matters, neither has an ideal policy mix for long-term fiscal stability. Alternation of governments may provide the best policy mix.},

The "What" identifies the specific software being used and the "How" explains the way they are integrated together during problem solving steps.

The authors argue that political divisions over masks cannot be understood by looking to partisan differences in mask-wearing behaviors alone. Instead, they show how the mask became a political symbol enrolled into patterns of affective polarization. This study relies on qualitative and computational analyses of opinion articles (n = 7,970) and supplemental analyses of Twitter data, the transcripts of major news networks, and longitudinal survey data. First, the authors show that antimask discourse was consistently marginal and that backlash against mask refusal came to prominence and did not decline even as masking behaviors normalized and partly depolarized. Second, they show that backlash against mask refusal, rather than mask refusal itself, was the primary way masks were discussed in relation to national electoral, governmental, and partisan themes.},

We argue that two markedly different mechanisms explain this discrepancy. First, within any particular political and economic context, people are more likely to benefit from redistribution, and hence support it, when inequality is high. Second, both inequality and attitudes toward redistribution are affected by characteristics unique to provincial political cultures, which results in attitudes toward redistribution having a different baseline depending on the province. We end with a discussion of the policy implications of these findings.},

This relationship between closeness and participation is intriguing because (1) it implies that people participate in elections because their vote might be decisive, but (2) such an incentive to vote is unreasonable. This study presents a theoretical model that suggests that closeness does not affect the turnout rate directly but rather through the marketing activities of the parties. In other words, in equilibrium, close elections attract higher marketing spending, which in turn increases turnout. The author uses data on the 1996-2004 presidential elections in the United States to examine the model and its implications. Using structural (and nonstructural) estimation, the author finds that the data support the model and its implications. Furthermore, the effect of marketing on turnout is dramatic. For example, if the marketing activity were canceled in the 2004 elections, the number of voters would have decreased by 15 million.},

  abstract = {A commonly-held belief is that many university students are `assessment-driven'; that is, students engage more with activities that are assessed compared with those that are not. `Incentivised engagement' includes the practice of providing incentives (such as marks or otherwise) for students to engage in particular activities. Perusall is a social annotation platform designed to increase student engagement with pre-class reading. In this study, students in a second-year undergraduate Statistics for Engineering module were invited to carry out the weekly reading activity via the Perusall platform. During the first half of the semester, students' engagement via Perusall did not count towards student marks, whereas during the second half of the semester, it did. We present the estimated effect of incentivised engagement, via use of the Perusall platform, on student engagement and performance. Our results show that incentivisation increased the engagement of students who were previously less engaged with the pre-class reading. For those students who were previously less engaged and had lower performance in summative assessments, there was also an increase in student performance following incentivisation. However, this effect was not observed for students who were already performing well before incentivisation.},

  abstract = {Exposure to traffic-related pollution (TRP) and tobacco smoke have been associated with new onset asthma in children. Psychosocial stress-related susceptibility has been proposed to explain social disparities in asthma. We investigated whether low socioeconomic status (SES) or high parental stress modified the effect of TRP and in utero tobacco smoke exposure on new onset asthma. We identified 2,497 children aged 5--9 years with no history of asthma or wheeze at study entry (2002--2003) into the Children's Health Study, a prospective cohort study in southern California. The primary outcome was parental report of doctor-diagnosed new onset asthma during 3 years of follow-up. Residential exposure to TRP was assessed using a line source dispersion model. Information about maternal smoking during pregnancy, parental education (a proxy for SES), and parental stress were collected in the study baseline questionnaire. The risk of asthma attributable to TRP was significantly higher for subjects with high parental stress (HR 1.51 across the interquartile range for TRP; 95\% CI 1.16--1.96) than for subjects with low parental stress (HR 1.05, 95\% CI 0.74--1.49; interaction P value 0.05). Stress also was associated with larger effects of in utero tobacco smoke. A similar pattern of increased risk of asthma was observed among children from low SES families who also were exposed to either TRP or in utero tobacco smoke. These results suggest that children from stressful households are more susceptible to the effects of TRP and in utero tobacco smoke on the development of asthma.},

  abstract = {The relationship between freedom of religion and sexual orientation equality rights in Canada (and elsewhere) is frequently seen as one of inherent tension and conflict. In the three decades since the entrenchment of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the nature of this relationship has become more publicly visible and more publicly debated, as jurisprudence regarding equality rights and freedom of religion has sought to define itself and as public perceptions about rights claims increasingly become part of the landscape. However, unsurprisingly, the relationship as it is portrayed in legal and public discourses and as it is represented in media coverage, is a very narrow picture of the complexity of both religious identity and sexually diverse identities. In this article, I will summarize the development of jurisprudence in Canada as it connects with cases to do with sexual diversity and religion (in conflict or at the intersections). A small group of vocal opponents to sexual diversity and equality rights for the sexually diverse frequently become generalized as representing ``the religious'' view regarding sexuality and sexual identity. Subsequently, the public representation of religion is tied to anti-homosexual or anti-feminist attitudes, although the reality is that the religious voices that are represented within these debates and cases are recurring individuals and groups and represent only a portion of the broader traditions to which they belong.},

Instead, voting seems to have been channeled largely by social and economic structures.

  abstract = {"Game changer." We heard it so many times during the 2012 U.S. presidential election. But what actually made a difference in the contest{\^a}and what was just hype? In this groundbreaking book, John Sides and Lynn Vavreck tell the dramatic story of the election{\^a}with a big difference. Using an unusual "moneyball" approach and drawing on extensive quantitative data, they look beyond the anecdote, folklore, and conventional wisdom that often pass for election analysis to separate what was truly important from what was irrelevant. The Gamble combines this data with the best social science research and colorful on-the-ground reporting, providing the most accurate and precise account of the election yet written{\^a}and the only book of its kind. In a new preface, the authors reflect on the place of The Gamble in the tradition of presidential election studies, its reception to date, and possible paths for future social science research.},

Featuring a new afterword by the authors that discusses the 2018 midterms and today's emerging political trends, this compelling book describes how Trump's victory was foreshadowed by changes in the Democratic and Republican coalitions that were driven by people's racial and ethnic identities, and how the Trump campaign exacerbated these divisions by hammering away on race, immigration, and religion. The result was an epic battle not just for the White House but about what America should be.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Centralization and decentralization are enduring themes in Canadian political life. But measurement, explanation, prediction and especially assessment of these terms are all deeply problematic. Various modernization theorists once confidently predicted increasing centralization. The confounding of these predictions in Canada in the 1960s and 1970s forces us to consider the sources of Canadian ``exceptionalism'' and to see modernization as embracing contrasting tendencies. Similarly, for the future, it is possible to identify a variety of forces, social and economic, which seem to push toward, or to require, a more centralized polity. But these forces too are Janus-headed. And a powerful case can be made that a decentralized system is better placed to meet contemporary challenges than a more centralized one. The alternatives are not either/or; and Canada's experience in responding politically to fragmentation may provide valuable lessons for others. Sommaire: La centralisation et la d{\'e}centralisation sont des th{\'e}mes caract{\'e}ristiques de la vie politique canadienne. Cependant, il est extr{\^e}mement d{\'e}licat de les mesurer, de les expliquer, de pr{\'e}voir leur importance et surtout de les {\'e}valuer. De par le pass{\'e}, divers th{\'e}oriciens de la modernisation ont pr{\'e}dit avec assurance une centralisation accrue. L'inexactitude de ces pr{\'e}dictions au Canada dans les ann{\'e}es 1960 et 1970 nous force {\`a} examiner les causes de la situation ``exceptionnelle'' du Canada et {\`a} voir la modernisation comme un regroupement de tendances contradictoires. Ainsi, pour l'avenir, on peut identifier diverses forces, sociales et {\'e}conomiques, qui semblent favoriser et m{\^e}me requ{\'e}rir un r{\'e}gime plus centralis{\'e}. Cependant, ces forces ne sont pas univoques. On peut {\`a} juste titre avancer qu'un syst{\`e}me d{\'e}centralis{\'e} est plus apte {\`a} r{\'e}pondre aux d{\'e}fis contemporains qu'un syst{\`e}me plus centralis{\'e}.

  abstract = {Science communication has been historically predicated on the knowledge deficit model. Yet, empirical research has shown that public communication of science is more complex than what the knowledge deficit model suggests. In this essay, we pose four lines of reasoning and present empirical data for why we believe the deficit model still persists in public communication of science. First, we posit that scientists' training results in the belief that public audiences can and do process information in a rational manner. Second, the persistence of this model may be a product of current institutional structures. Many graduate education programs in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields generally lack formal training in public communication. We offer empirical evidence that demonstrates that scientists who have less positive attitudes toward the social sciences are more likely to adhere to the knowledge deficit model of science communication. Third, we present empirical evidence of how scientists conceptualize ``the public'' and link this to attitudes toward the deficit model. We find that perceiving a knowledge deficit in the public is closely tied to scientists' perceptions of the individuals who comprise the public. Finally, we argue that the knowledge deficit model is perpetuated because it can easily influence public policy for science issues. We propose some ways to uproot the deficit model and move toward more effective science communication efforts, which include training scientists in communication methods grounded in social science research and using approaches that engage community members around scientific issues.},

In this book Adam Simon argues that democracy requires that government listen to the public and that sample surveys are the finest democratic technology yet devised. He lays out the fundamentals of public opinion research and illustrates his discussion of the science of polling with recent political hot button issues as case studies\_the decision to invade Iraq, partial birth abortion, and the Clinton health care debate. He advocates that poll results meet the standard for mass informed consent and should play a larger role in our politics. Simon concludes with recommendations to improve democracy from the standpoint of citizens, politicians, and the media. Mass Informed Consent will be of special interest to students of public opinion, political behavior, media and politics, interest group politics, and political communication.},

Time-series analysis then charts the path of ``baby's'' discursive dominance from congressional discourse through news and editorials to citizens. Finally, experimental results support 2 microlevel hypotheses. First, uptake---exposure to articles featuring the exclusive use of ``baby'' or ``fetus,'' respectively, increased or decreased support for banning PBA. Second, emergence---participants exposed to discourse using both terms converged upon a response independent of the words' relative proportions. In contrast to probabilistic survey response models, these findings support the idea that a kind of public reason can emerge from the interaction of citizens' judgment processes and elite communication.},

Risk as analysis brings logic, reason, and scientific deliberation to bear on risk management. Reliance on risk as feelings is described with "the affect heuristic." The authors trace the development of this heuristic across a variety of research paths. The authors also discuss some of the important practical implications resulting from ways that this heuristic impacts how people perceive and evaluate risk, and, more generally, how it influences all human decision making. Finally, some important implications of the affect heuristic for communication and decision making pertaining to cancer prevention and treatment are briefly discussed.

The first relates to cultural dualism, the desire and ability of French- and English-speaking Canadians to survive as such and to use the governmental institutions which they respectively dominate in order to ensure this outcome. The second involves public action to meet the material expectations of individuals and groups living within an economy where burdens and benefits have been determined largely by the economic policies of successive federal administrations. Those who have concerned themselves with Canadian federalism have usually believed, explicitly or implicitly, that either the cultural or the economic problem was the major challenge which the federal system faced. Thus there are two versions of what our constitutional arrangements are all about, and these are most strikingly illustrated by the divergent perspectives of the Rowell-Sirois and Tremblay Commission. The former was almost exclusively concerned with the reallocation of revenues, revenue sources, and functional responsibilities between the two levels of government and did not deal in any explicit way with the impact of existing or proposed arrangements on the survival of the two cultures. To the Tremblay Commission the great theme of our constitutional history since Confederation is the attempt of English-speaking Canada to subvert the original federal compact and the resistance of these attempts by French Canadians; its Report does deal in great detail with economic issues but its basic argument is that the essential and permanent value of Canadian federalism is to make possible the survival of the two cultural groups.},

Others have argued that human populations have always modified their environments, often in ways that enhance short-term gains at the expense of environmental stability and biodiversity conservation. Recent ethnographic studies as well as theory from several disciplines allow a less polarized assessment. We review this body of data and theory and assess various predictions regarding sustainable environmental utilization. The meaning of the term conservation is itself controversial. We propose that to qualify as conservation, any action or practice must not only prevent or mitigate resource overharvesting or environmental damage, it must also be designed to do so. The conditions under which conservation will be adaptive are stringent, involving temporal discounting, economic demand, information feedback, and collective action. Theory thus predicts, and evidence suggests, that voluntary conservation is rare. However, sustainable use and management of resources and habitats by small-scale societies is widespread and may often indirectly result in biodiversity preservation or even enhancement via creation of habitat mosaics.},

Since theorists disagree on the democratic credentials of federalism, it is essential to look at how a real federal system operates. Smith examines the origins of Canadian federalism and its special features, then analyzes it in relation to the benchmarks of the Canadian Democratic Audit project: responsiveness, inclusiveness, and participation. Finding that Canadian federalism falls short on each benchmark, she recommends changes ranging from virtual regionalism to a Council of the Federation that includes Aboriginal representatives. Democracy is about more than the House of Commons or elections. It is also about federalism. This sparkling account of Canadian federalism is a must-read for students and scholars of Canadian politics, politicians and policymakers, and those who care about Canadian democracy.},

Pollution is no longer just about belching smokestacks and ugly sewer pipes - now, it's personal. The most dangerous pollution has always come from commonplace items in our homes and workplaces. Smith and Lourie ingested and inhaled a host of things that surround all of us all the time. This book exposes the extent to which we are poisoned every day of our lives. For this book, over the period of a week - the kind of week that would be familiar to most people - the authors use their own bodies as the reference point and tell the story of pollution in our modern world, the miscreant corporate giants who manufacture the toxins, the weak-kneed government officials who let it happen, and the effects on people and families across the globe. Parents and concerned citizens will have to read this book. Key concerns raised in Slow Death by Rubber Duck: " Flame-retardant chemicals from electronics and household dust polluting our blood. " Toxins in our urine caused by leaching from plastics and run-of-the-mill shampoos, toothpastes and deodorant. " Mercury in our blood from eating tuna. " The chemicals that build up in our body when carpets and upholstery off-gas. Ultimately hopeful, the book empowers readers with some simple ideas for protecting themselves and their families, and changing things for the better. From the Hardcover edition.},

Social marketing has been widely applied for more than three decades in the fields of public health, environmental protection, and political marketing with significant success. The paper attempts to distinguish between the practice of commercial marketing, whose goal is profit, and the practice of social marketing, whose goal is societal benefit. Issues of sustainability, segmentation, differences in behavioral characteristics, and cultural competence are discussed with specific examples drawn from the transportation safety literature. The paper suggests that social marketing represents a viable companion to control and education approaches to behavior change to promote teen driving safety.},

Ronald Smith shows how to implement pragmatic, research-driven strategic campaigns used in public relations practice, and draws from his years of experience as a professional in the industry and his years of teaching in the classroom.  The approach used in this text is a threefold pattern: first, readers are exposed to new ideas, then see them in use, before finally being showed how to apply those ideas themselves. Complex problem-solving and decision-making processes in strategic communication and public relations are turned into a series of easy-to-follow steps, flexible enough to be applicable to myriad situations and organizations in the real world.  This new fifth edition follows the same format as previous editions and includes numerous timely and real-world examples of cases and current events, along with classic cases that stand the test of time. It includes new research on opinions and practices within the discipline and covers several recent, award-winning public relations campaigns.},

The assumption underlying this practice is that respondents will answer the two formats similarly. In this research note we report results from 16 experimental comparisons in two Web surveys and a paper survey conducted in 2002 and 2003 that test whether the check-all and forced-choice formats produce similar results. In all 16 comparisons, we find that the two question formats do not perform similarly; respondents endorse more options and take longer to answer in the forced-choice format than in the check-all format. These findings suggest that the forced-choice question format encourages deeper processing of response options and, as such, is preferable to the check-all format, which may encourage a weak satisficing response strategy. Additional analyses show that neither acquiescence bias nor item nonresponse seem to pose substantial problems for use of the forced-choice question format in Web surveys.},

The specific aim of this study is to test the validity of predictions derived from two theories---realistic conflict, which emphasizes considerations of economic well-being, and social identity, which emphasizes considerations of identity based on group membership. The larger aim of this study is to investigate the interplay of predisposing factors and situational triggers in evoking political responses. The analysis is based on a series of three experiments embedded in a public opinion survey carried out in The Netherlands (               n               =2007) in 1997--98. The experiments, combined with parallel individual-level measures, allow measurement of the comparative impact of both dispositionally based and situationally triggered threats to economic well-being and to national identity at work. The results show, first, that considerations of national identity dominate those of economic advantage in evoking exclusionary reactions to immigrant minorities and, second, that the effect of situational triggers is to mobilize support for exclusionary policies above and beyond the core constituency already predisposed to support them.},

The authors have applied the most sophisticated methods of analysis and have employed new research techniques, integrating experimentation with survey research through computer-assisted interviewing. . . . The studies presented here address some of the most provocative and troublesome issues in contemporary politics, such as whether or not the AIDS [acquired immune deficiency syndrome] epidemic has triggered increased hostility toward homosexuals and how prevalent racism is in American society.  "Reasoning and Choice" is a major new contribution to the literature in public opinion and political psychology and is essential reading for all scholars and students studying political reasoning.

  abstract = {Research on symbolic racism attempts to identify the underlying psychological sources of public resistance to policies designed to promote racial equality. This research program has been built on the fundamental idea that, although old-fashioned, overt forms of racism have lost much of their appeal in American politics, new, more subtle and symbolic forms of racism continue to exert a pervasive influence on policy debates, making themselves felt, for example, in opposition to busing, to affirmative action, or even to black candidates running for office. This paper identifies serious empirical, logical, and methodological shortcomings in the case that researchers have advanced to support the symbolic racism thesis. Most serious are (a) the lack of clarity in theoretical definitions of symbolic racism, (b) the major inconsistencies in the operationalization of the construct, (c) the confounding of ``independent'' and ``dependent'' variables in the construction of symbolic racism scales, (d) the politically controversial nature of the item content of certain symbolic racism scales, (e) the frequent failures to distinguish the impact of traditional racial prejudice from that of symbolic racism on policy preferences, and (f) the tendency to pose a very restrictive conception of self-interest as the major explanatory alternative to symbolic racism interpretations of policy preferences.},

Although the clause exists as a legitimate constitutional instrument, it has been used infrequently, and never by the federal government. This paper examines arguments put forward to explain the infrequent use of the clause. Of all the explanations offered, the historical-institutionalist concept of ``path dependence'' is most compelling. Ever since the Quebec government used the notwithstanding clause in response to Ford v. Quebec (1988), subsequent Prime Ministers have demonized the clause in order to gain political capital. The depiction of section 33 as inherently antithetical to the logic of a Charter of Rights has been so successful that few political leaders will risk using the clause, even when public opinion is in favour. With the Charter being seen as a ``symbolic rights-giver,'' this demonization has led to the gradual erosion of section 33's legitimacy as an acceptable legislative instrument.},

Rational ignorance is fully compatible with the so-called ``paradox of voting'' because it will often be rational for citizens to vote, but irrational for them to become well informed. Furthermore, rational ignorance leads not only to inadequate acquisition of political information, but also to ineffective use of the information that citizens do possess. The combination of these two problems has fundamental implications for a variety of issues in public policy and international affairs.},

We argue that states' decisions to enact such legislation are influenced by both state characteristics and the monitoring of the actions of other states. We find that the repeal of a sodomy law in a state does not increase its rate of enactment, but as more and more states enact hate crime laws, those that have repealed their sodomy laws are more likely to follow suit. We also find that states in which the political party of the governor differs from that of the majority of legislators are more likely to become referents to this process, so that once they have enacted a hate crime law, others quickly follow suit. We find no support for the claim that hate crime laws diffused within regions. Finally, with regard to state-level characteristics, we find that wealthier states with Democrat-dominated legislatures that have been policy innovators in the past have higher rates of enactment. Those states that have passed an earlier, less controversial...},

The choice broke Southam's tradition of recruiting editors as publishers. Born and raised in Saskatchewan, Ken King peddled ads for Southam's Prince George Citizen, Edmonton Journal and the Herald. He then moved to the Toronto Sun organization, working in Edmonton and Calgary for the past decade. In 1991, he jumped from the Calgary Sun to the Herald as associate publisher under Kevin Peterson, the daily's youthful publisher. But Mr. King repented just a few days later. Upon returning to the Sun, the prodigal stated: "Honour and truth mean everything to me. I've betrayed a group I respect and adore." However, this December Mr. Peterson "resigned" to pursue unspecified career options. Weeks later Mr. King again boarded the Herald. "I do not apologize for that, although I wouldn't recommend it from a careercounselling standpoint," he says in reference to the switches. "I think Southam is about to embark on a significant and aggressive path of change and I've simply chosen to take part in that reformation."},

This altered motivational structure encourages the writer to engage in perspective taking, thereby addressing confirmation bias and motivated reasoning. I outline a three-part structure of the complexity paper using the example of physician-assisted suicide with the goal to help university instructors implement this genre into their courses.

In addition to the built-in functions, a number of readily available packages from CRAN (the Comprehensive R Archive Network) are also covered. All of the methods presented take advantage of the core features of R: vectorization, efficient use of subscripting, and the proper use of the varied functions in R that are provided for common data management tasks. Most experienced R users discover that, especially when working with large data sets, it may be helpful to use other programs, notably databases, in conjunction with R. Accordingly, the use of databases in R is covered in detail, along with methods for extracting data from spreadsheets and datasets created by other programs. Character manipulation, while sometimes overlooked within R, is also covered in detail, allowing problems that are traditionally solved by scripting languages to be carried out entirely within R. For users with experience in other languages, guidelines for the effective use of programming constructs like loops are provided. Since many statistical modeling and graphics functions need their data presented in a data frame, techniques for converting the output of commonly used functions to data frames are provided throughout the book.},

We establish that constituencies' religious composition is a key empirical predictor of Nazi vote shares---dwarfing the explanatory power of any other demographic or socioeconomic variable. Even after carefully accounting for observational differences, Catholics were far less likely to vote for the NSDAP than their Protestant counterparts. The evidence suggests that this disparity was, in large part, due to the sway of the Catholic Church and its dignitaries. At the same time, we show that attempts to immunize Catholics against the radical left failed to achieve the desired result. To explain the puzzling asymmetry in the Church's influence at the ballot box, we develop a simple theoretical framework of elite influence in electoral politics.},

Research shows that the salience of immigration shapes voters' political behavior, but little is known about whether it influences judicial behavior. This article theorizes that variation in issue salience influences judges' behavior when there is a clear connection between the legal and a generally salient, politicized issue. I test this argument drawing on all Swiss asylum appeal decisions reached between 2007 and 2015. I find that higher asylum salience leads judges to decide otherwise similar asylum appeals less favorably. This effect is not restricted to judges affiliated with anti-immigrant parties, unlikely to be driven by accountability pressures, and strongest for those topics known to drive anti-immigrant sentiment in the general public. Together, these findings raise concerns that issue salience threatens the consistency of judicial decisions.},

More specifically, our paper has two objectives. First, we extend recent research by Akkerman et al. by showing that their measure performs rather well in a context that differs from the one it was originally formulated in. Data from Flanders (the Dutch speaking part of Belgium, N = 1,577) also demonstrate that the support for populism can be empirically distinguished from feelings of lack of external political efficacy. Second, this is one of the first studies that assess who supports populism and why they do so. We show that populism is embedded in deep feelings of discontent, not only with politics but also with societal life in general. Moreover, we demonstrate that populism is strongest supported by stigmatized groups who face difficulties in finding a positive social identity. In the conclusion, we discuss the implications of our findings.},

Because of problems inherent to the interpretation of the archaeological record, the genesis of these transformations often can only be ambiguously attributed to environmental and/or anthropogenic origins. However, at any given time or place, both the distribution of the numbers of different kinds of organisms and their relative abundances were in a constant state of flux since the retreat of glacial cover some 10,000 years ago. Here I review archaeological evidence to illustrate the dynamism of prehistoric biodiversity, which can be attributed to environmental events, to anthropogenic causation, or as a response of these to each other.},

  abstract = {Public inquiries remain the pre-eminent mechanism for lesson-learning after high-profile failures. However, a regular complaint is that their recommendations get `shelved'. In political science, the most common explanation for this lack of implementation tells us that elites mobilize bias in order to undermine inquiry lesson-learning. This article tests this thesis via an international comparison of inquiries in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the UK. A series of alternative explanations for shelving emerge, which tell us that inquiry recommendations do not get implemented when: they do not respect the realities of policy transfer; they are triaged into policy refinement mechanisms; and they arrive at the `street level' without consideration of local delivery capacities. These explanations tell us that the mobilization of bias thesis needs to be reworked in relation to public inquiries so that it better recognizes the complex reality of public policy in the modern state.},

To address this issue the current study assessed the prevalence and sociodemographic correlates of scientifically unsubstantiated beliefs about cancer risk in a representative sample of the US population.METHODS. Nine hundred fifty-seven US adults with no history of cancer were surveyed by telephone. The survey included 12 statements about cancer risk, risk factors, and prevention that were framed to be contrary to the consensus of current scientific evidence.RESULTS. Participants were inconsistent in their ability to identify the statements as false, and appraisal accuracy was associated with several sociodernographic characteristics. Five of the 12 misconceptions were endorsed as true by at least a quarter of the respondents, and uncertainty was higher than 15\% for 7 statements. At the same time, more than two-thirds of the participants were able to identify 7 statements as false and, on average, respondents endorsed fewer than 3 statements as true. Respondents who were male, older, non-White, less educated, and of lower income were most likely to hold inaccurate beliefs.CONCLUSIONS. A notable percentage of the participants in this study hold beliefs about cancer risk at odds with the prevailing scientific evidence. Because the population segments with the least accurate knowledge also bear the greatest burden of cancer, areas for public education and intervention efforts are identified. Cancer 2007;110:1139-48.

  abstract = {In this article, we summarize the individual demand-level factors explaining the radical right-wing vote in European countries. To do so, we first review 46 quantitative peer-reviewed articles featuring the individual vote choice in favour of a radical right-wing party as the dependent variable. To identify relevant articles, we use Kai Arzheimer's bibliography on the radical right and employ the following inclusion criterion: the articles must be written in English, they must use the individual vote for a radical right-wing party as the dependent variable, they must use a quantitative methodology and they must include some type of regression analysis. Using this strategy, we conduct a meta-analysis of 329 relevant models and find that over 20 individual variables are tested. Because many variables such as attitudes towards immigration, employment, age, education and gender only show moderate success rates in attempting to explain an individual's propensity to vote for the radical right, we complement the review of quantitative studies with an analysis of 14 qualitative publications. The review of these qualitative works shows that the processes through which somebody becomes a voter, supporter or activist of the radical right are often more complex than the commonly used surveys can portray them. Frequently, feelings of relative economic deprivation and dissatisfaction with the political regime trigger an awakening that makes individuals seek engagement. However, the processes behind this awakening are complex and can only be partially captured by quantitative studies.},

  abstract = {Designing and implementing a renewable energy policy involves political decisions and actors. Yet most research on renewable energy policies comparatively evaluates instruments from an economic or technical perspective. This paper presents a case study of Ontario's feed-in tariff policies between 1997 and 2012 to analyze how the political process affects renewable energy policy design and implementation. Ontario's policy, although initially successful, has met with increasing resistance over time. The case reveals key political tensions that arise during implementation. First, high-level support for a policy does not necessarily translate into widespread public support, particularly for local deployment. Second, the government often struggles under asymmetric information during price setting, which may weaken the policy's legitimacy with the public due to higher costs. Third, there is an unacknowledged tension that governments must navigate between policy stability, to spur investment, and adaptive policymaking, to improve policy design. Fourth, when multiple jurisdictions pursue the same policies simultaneously, international political conflict over jobs and innovation may occur. These implementation tensions result from political choices during policy design and present underappreciated challenges to transforming the electricity system. Governments need to critically recognize the political dimension of renewable energy policies to secure sustained political support.},

  abstract = {The regression discontinuity (RD) design offers identification of causal effects under weak assumptions, earning it the position as a standard method in modern political science research. But identification does not necessarily imply that the causal effects can be estimated accurately with limited data. In this paper, we highlight that estimation is particularly challenging with the RD design and investigate how these challenges manifest themselves in the empirical literature. We collect all RD-based findings published in top political science journals from 2009--2018. The findings exhibit pathological features; estimates tend to bunch just above the conventional level of statistical significance. A reanalysis of all studies with available data suggests that researcher's discretion is not a major driver of these pathological features, but researchers tend to use inappropriate methods for inference, rendering standard errors artificially small. A retrospective power analysis reveals that most of these studies were underpowered to detect all but large effects. The issues we uncover, combined with well-documented selection pressures in academic publishing, cause concern that many published findings using the RD design are exaggerated, if not entirely spurious.},

  abstract = {Abstract Citizens, especially those who are knowledgeable and care the most about politics, are motivated to defend their beliefs and attitudes in the face of discrepant information. These motivated biases strongly influence the way people think about health care policies and the politicians and parties that propose or attack these conten-tious policies. Three cognitive mechanisms are identified: a prior belief effect, confir-mation bias, and disconfirmation bias. Together, these information processes conspire to produce persistence and polarization of opinion on health care policies. Citizens, especially those who know and care the most about public poli-cies, are not open- minded. They are not inclined toward balance or even-handedness when thinking about and discussing politics. Rather, they are motivated reasoners who seek out congenial sources of information and defend their attitudes and beliefs when challenged, and as a consequence they tend to polarize in the face of both confirming and disconfirming information. This article reviews motivated reasoning research and con-siders the implications of motivated reasoning for rational public opinion. As we illustrate our theory of motivated reasoning, we provide examples of how cognitive biases influence a wide range of health- related attitudes, from broad, national decisions about health reform to individual decisions about caffeine consumption and smoking. Our primary theme is the importance of understanding how internal motivations and biases can influence deliberative cognitive processing.

Yet there is still disagreement about its nature and extent as well as what accounts for its development. This paper examines male-female differences in voting behavior in terms of three frequently offered explanations: inequalities in socioeconomic attainment, greater situational constraints on women, and differences in political orientations. Methods. We analyze survey data from the 1993 Australian Election Survey, the 1992 British Election Survey, and the 1992 American National Election Survey by using a regression decomposition technique for blocks of variables representing each of the three explanations for gender differences. Results. Our findings provide some evidence to support each explanation. For example, in both Britain and Australia, the two major consistently discriminating factors are gender inequalities in socioeconomic attainment and situational constraints. Such factors as women's greater familial responsibilities and their differing occupational experiences help explain the gender gap in these countries. In the United States, however, it is predominantly political orientations---namely, that women are significantly more likely to favor the left side of some common political issues, which explains their differing electoral choices. Conclusions. Although gender differences in voting behavior are a widely observed phenomenon, the explanation for them is not the same in these three countries. Socioeconomic and situational factors are more important in Britain and Australia while political factors are more influential in the United States.},

BPA was offered to female Sprague-Dawley Crl:CD (SD) rats (24 per dose group) and their litters at dietary concentrations of 0 (control), 0.15, 1.5, 75, 750, and 2250 ppm daily from gestation day 0 through lactation day 21.

For F(1) offspring, there were no treatment-related neurobehavioral effects, nor was there evidence of neuropathology or effects on brain morphometry. Based on maternal and offspring body weight reductions, the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for systemic toxicity was 75 ppm (5.85 and 13.1 mg/kg/day during gestation and lactation, respectively), with no treatment-related effects at lower doses or nonmonotonic dose responses observed for any parameter. There was no evidence that BPA is a developmental neurotoxicant in rats, and the NOAEL for developmental neurotoxicity was 2250 ppm, the highest dose tested (164 and 410 mg/kg/day during gestation and lactation, respectively).}

Design Retrospective quantitative content analysis. Setting Journal articles, press releases, and related news, with accompanying simulations. Sample Press releases (n=462) on biomedical and health related science issued by 20 leading UK universities in 2011, alongside their associated peer reviewed research papers and news stories (n=668). Main outcome measures Advice to readers to change behaviour, causal statements drawn from correlational research, and inference to humans from animal research that went beyond those in the associated peer reviewed papers. Results 40\% (95\% confidence interval 33\% to 46\%) of the press releases contained exaggerated advice, 33\% (26\% to 40\%) contained exaggerated causal claims, and 36\% (28\% to 46\%) contained exaggerated inference to humans from animal research. When press releases contained such exaggeration, 58\% (95\% confidence interval 48\% to 68\%), 81\% (70\% to 93\%), and 86\% (77\% to 95\%) of news stories, respectively, contained similar exaggeration, compared with exaggeration rates of 17\% (10\% to 24\%), 18\% (9\% to 27\%), and 10\% (0\% to 19\%) in news when the press releases were not exaggerated. Odds ratios for each category of analysis were 6.5 (95\% confidence interval 3.5 to 12), 20 (7.6 to 51), and 56 (15 to 211). At the same time, there was little evidence that exaggeration in press releases increased the uptake of news. Conclusions Exaggeration in news is strongly associated with exaggeration in press releases. Improving the accuracy of academic press releases could represent a key opportunity for reducing misleading health related news.}

Consistent with the conceptual framework, the results indicate that job insecurity has detrimental consequences for employees' job attitudes, organizational attitudes, health, and, to some extent, their behavioral relationship with the organization. Moderator analyses suggest that these relationships may be underestimated in studies relying on single-item measures of job insecurity and that the behavioral consequences of insecurity are more detrimental among manual, as compared with nonmanual, workers. Recommendations made for future research include utilization of multidimensional measures, consideration of a broader spectrum of outcomes and moderators, and use of longitudinal designs.

In their response, De Jong et al. (2023) reiterated their advocacy for inquiry approaches, arguing that an emphasis on a mixture of inquiry learning and explicit instruction is needed. The present article rebuts De Jong et al. (2023), in which we: 1) challenge their view of and approach to scientific methods in establishing the efficacy of different instructional approaches; 2) indicate that an underpinning theory to explain the cognitive machinery that drives inquiry-based instructional approaches is missing from their argument; and 3) address the empirical issues arising in their argument. We also highlight potential agreement with De Jong et al. (2023) on the essential role of explicit instruction and thus raise a call to the field to revise current science educational policies and standards to reflect such a role. Our agreements and disagreements advance the debate to a new focus concerning when and how inquiry-based learning and explicit instruction should be used and combined. While De Jong et al. (2023), in their theory-free paper, provided no answer to how explicit instruction and inquiry learning should be combined, we offer our suggestions based on evolutionary psychology and the expertise reversal effect from cognitive load theory.},

In this discussion, I will briefly outline some of the cognitive principles that underlie cognitive load theory. The papers of this special issue provide the latest research on the worked example effect. One of the authors in this issue investigated the effects of solving problems (labelled active learning) or studying examples (labelled passive learning) with an emphasis on either the conditions of a conditioneaction pair or on both the conditions and actions. Two of the author in their first experiment found that providing learners with multiple solutions to a problem facilitated learning compared to a single solution. Two other authors also studied the effects of self-explanations versus instructional explanations and in the first experiment found that both instructional explanations and even no explanations were superior to self-explanations on conceptual learning. The worked example effect has helped advance our knowledge of human cognition. The papers of this special issue demonstrate the continuing value of research into this important effect.

  abstract = {Fear and anxiety are poorly delineated in much of the clinical and research literatures. Although some theorists and researchers have posited explanations for how trait fear and trait anxiety differ, many others conceptualize the constructs as largely or entirely interchangeable. The primary goals of this review are to examine clinical conceptualizations and neurobiological studies of fear and anxiety, examine the animal and human literatures on the correlates of fear and anxiety, provide clearer definitions of these two constructs, and discuss their implications for psychopathology. A secondary goal is to evaluate content of self-report measures of trait fear and anxiety, and meta-analyze the relations between self-reported trait fear and anxiety. We found that existing measures share significant content overlap across constructs. Despite this overlap, our meta-analysis revealed only a moderate (r = 0.32) relationship between measures of trait fear and anxiety, with an even lower relationship (r = 0.14) when we examined trait fear measures operationalized in terms of harm avoidance. These findings suggest that fear and anxiety are largely distinct emotions, and that psychological disorders of trait fear and trait anxiety warrant classification in separate higher-order categories. Moreover, they suggest that future research should focus on deriving more content valid measures of trait fear and trait anxiety from the neurobiological and diagnostic literatures.},

This is a deficiency because, as I shall argue, it provides us with a useful tool for understanding the pathology of representative politics. Populism is not a universal concept that, once unlocked, will enable us to decipher all other political debates, but it is a useful secondary concept that, if used sensitively and systematically, will enable us to understand populist movements, and which will, perhaps more importantly, allow us to understand essential elements in the politics of representation.},

It concludes that cultural theory continues to be of value, but that its role needs to be reassessed in the emerging age of deliberative science.

Finally, a general argument is made linking the spiral of silence and theories of the perception of public opinion to the analysis of the general class of social choice situations where peoples' expectations influence the outcome.

To his philosophical discourse, therefore, is added a sensitive knowledge of Quebec society from the vantage point of an English-speaking citizen with profound roots within it. Taylor suggests that it will be necessary to think in terms of deep diversity if Canada is to stay together in the twenty-first century.},

  abstract = {It appears that there are two distinct practices within public health, namely health promotion and disease prevention, leading to different goals. But does the distinction hold? Can we promote health without preventing disease, and vice versa? The aim of the paper is to answer these questions. First, the central concepts are defined and the logical relations between them are spelt out. A preliminary conclusion is that there is a logical difference between health and disease, which makes health promotion and disease prevention two distinct endeavours. However, since disease is defined in relation to health, as those kinds of internal processes and states that typically lead to ill health, the difference is smaller than it might appear. Second, in order to answer the practical question whether it is possible to promote health without preventing disease, and vice versa, several kinds of public health interventions are discussed. The conclusion is that while health promotion and disease prevention can be distinguished conceptually, they can hardly be distinguished in practice. Most general measures do both at the same time.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  abstract = {The present study illustrates the use of computer-aided text analysis to evaluate the content of open-ended survey responses. During an in-hall test, different varieties of mayonnaise were evaluated by 165 respondents on a 10-point liking scale, with the option to freely comment on these assessments. An expert panel assessed the main sensory characteristics of the mayonnaises. Usually, preference mapping is applied to find out which sensory attributes drive consumer preferences for products. As an alternative, we will use the consumer statements to investigate this relationship. By counting words and looking at word combinations, we will use correspondence analysis to construct a visualization that is comparable to a preference map. Results from the analyses of the verbal responses are compared with the results from preference mapping. The agreement between the correspondence map and the preference map is striking, with the additional advantage being that the correspondence map is stated in terms of consumer language. The textual map is also in line with consumer understanding about creaminess. It appears that respondents find it easier to comment on their dislikes than on their likes. Some advantages and disadvantages of analyzing open-ended survey responses are also addressed.},

The Age of Persuasion is for those who say ``advertising doesn't work on me'' as well as those who want to understand how this industry has become inseparable from modern culture. Using their popular CBC Radio series as a starting point, Terry O'Reilly and Mike Tennant tell the fascinating story of how modern marketing came of age --- from the early players to the Mad Men of the 1960s and beyond. With insider anecdotes and examples drawn from pop culture, they also probe deeply into the day-to-day workings and ethics of a business that is rapidly evolving in the age of Facebook and YouTube.},

Assuming that market and work experiences are crucial for people to develop common political views, it investigates three contexts that shape government employees' willingness to vote as a single constituency: the branch of public sector production, the occupational status, and the type of service economy. Estimation results obtained from regressions on European Social Survey (ESS) data indicate that government employees in public health, education and service production rather than public administration utilize sector cleavage voting. Regardless of their actual occupational status, public health and education employees show persistently stronger attitudes in favour of expanding state responsibility. With respect to party choice, stronger signs of alignment along the sector cleavage are observed in Social Democratic service economies. In sum, the public/private sector cleavage continues to matter in a more complex way than a simple sector dichotomy would suggest.},

This article helps fill that void by putting forth an account of priming and opinion change. I argue that crystallized attitudes should often be primed by new information. An influx of attention to less crystallized preferences, however, should lead individuals to alter their underlying opinions in accordance with prior beliefs. Since predispositions acquired early in the life cycle---such as partisanship, religiosity, basic values, and group-based affect/antagonisms---are more crystallized than mass opinion about public policy, media and campaign content will tend to prime citizens' predispositions and change their policy positions. Both my review of previous priming research and original analyses presented in this study from five new cases strongly support the crystallization-based account of when mass opinion is primed or changed. I conclude with a discussion of the article's potential political, methodological, and normative implications.},

Although existing research generally finds a modestly positive relationship between social media use and offline and online participation, the majority of contributions rely on cross-sectional data, so the causal impact of social media use remains unclear. The present study examines how Facebook use influences reported political participation using an experiment. We recruited young Greek participants without a Facebook account and randomly assigned a subset to create and maintain a Facebook account for a year. In this paper we examine the effect of having a Facebook account on diverse modes of online and offline participation after six months. We find that maintaining a Facebook account had clearly negative consequences on reports of offline and online forms of political and civic participation.},

In this context of economic crisis and austerity, populism has risen across North America and Europe on both the right and left of the political spectrum. The rise of right populism in particular confronts unions with key organizational and strategic challenges as neoliberal governments seek to mobilize right populist discourses in their efforts to restructure work and labour relations. Using a socio-geographic framework, and based on an examination of post-2008 legislative and policy measures undertaken at the federal, provincial, municipal levels in Canada, this paper explores the nexus between ``uneven austerity'', rising populism, and union strategic capacities. We examine this intersection of austerity and populism at multiple scales to reveal the implications for organized labour.},

Using data from the 2004--2011 Canadian federal elections, we find support for the sacrificial lamb hypothesis when district competitiveness is measured dynamically, rather than statically. Our dynamic measurement of district competitiveness further shows that women incumbents' seats are not as safe as are men's. We conclude that these two factors help to explain why women remain underrepresented in Canadian federal politics. Highlights~ ► Women's descriptive representation in Canada is suppressed because women candidates are sacrificial lambs. ► The relationship between district competitiveness and candidate gender holds for every federal party except the Bloc Qu{\'e}b{\'e}cois. ► A dynamic measure of party support is preferable to a static measure.},

Disorder: Hard Times in the 21st Century is a long history of this present political moment. It recounts three histories - one about geopolitics, one about the world economy, and one about western democracies - and explains how in the years of political disorder prior to the pandemic the disruption in each became one big story. It shows how much of this turbulence originated in problems generated by fossil-fuel energies, and it explains why as the green transition takes place the long-standing predicaments energy invariably shapes will remain in place.},

To read Thompson's dispatches from these years -- addressed to the author's friends, enemies, editors, and creditors, and such notables as Jimmy Carter, Tom Wolfe, and Kurt Vonnegut -- is to read a raw, revolutionary eyewitness account of one of the most exciting and pivotal eras in American history.},

Findings collectively suggest that internalization is a causal risk factor for body-image and eating disturbances, and that it appears to operate in conjunction with other established risk factors for these outcomes, including dieting and negative effect. Future research is needed to examine the specific familial, peer, and media influences that promote internalization and to replicate and extend our prospective and experimental studies.},

Another is that Kastner is too chummy with the evil horde in the Legislature's press gallery and is therefore viewed with suspicion by the premier's inner sanctum. [Gordon Turtle], who hired Kastner last November, won't explain the reasons behind the shuffle but insists it's simply routine. "There's nothing very deep or profound to read into this." Turtle won't say what Kastner will be doing in his new job, probably because it sounds like nobody has figured out what Kastner's new job will be. Some Tory insiders say Kastner is a victim, the fall guy for Klein's chief of staff Steve West who allowed the premier to wander off half-cocked for much of the year -- browbeating an opposition member, stomping out of a news conference, releasing an embarrassingly inadequate university essay. Some party officials are blaming West for the missteps, pointing out Klein began to stumble after the departure of his former chief of staff, Peter Elzinga.},

The government doesn't usually release polling results, a policy they relaxed to their dismay in May when a telephone poll of 1,000 Albertans indicated 72 per cent supported the Kyoto accord. Kyoto supporters focused simply on that number much to [Ralph Klein]'s frustration. He said the really important fact was that 42 per cent of those polled didn't know any details of the accord, showing that people were uninformed and needed information. Alberta politicians argue the more people know about Kyoto, the less they like it. Supporting that view, a national poll released by CROP (a partner of Environics) three weeks ago indicated the support for the accord dropped as pollsters asked people "to consider its implications."},

  abstract = {In The Invented State, Emily Thorson argues that a problematic and understudied aspect of political misinformation reflects widespread public misperception about what the government does. Because much of public policy is invisible to the public, there is fertile ground for false beliefs to flourish, leading to the creation of what Thorson terms the "invented state" systematic misperceptions about public policy. However, people get the facts wrong not because they are lazy, stupid, or blinded by partisan loyalty. Rather, misperceptions are created when three conditions are met: when citizens have incomplete information about an issue, when their own biases color their understanding of it, and when they feel that the issue is important. In other words, the invented state is created not just by exposure to explicit misinformation, but also by individuals' cognitive errors. Correcting these policy misperceptions is highly effective at reducing false beliefs. In addition, providing people with corrective information has downstream effects on attitudes. When they learn how policies - including Social Security, refugee policy, and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program - really work, their approval of these policies increases, and they also shift their policy priorities. Contrary to pundits' assumptions of a public who is largely indifferent to policy, there is a deep public desire to learn basic facts about how the government works. Thorson meets that desire with analysis on how the news media can identify and effectively correct substantive policy misperceptions. The Invented State not only sheds a new light on how Americans think about policy, but can also help to inform evidence-based interventions to improve democratic competence.},

Data from the 2008 National Annenberg Election Survey suggest that (a) attempting to persuade contributes to people's ability to give reasons in support of both their own preferred candidate and the opposing candidate, and (b) persuasive conversation is a powerful channel for the spread of political information from the more engaged to the less engaged.},

  abstract = {Purpose - Through a comprehensive literature review and data analysis, the purpose of this paper is to adopt a multi-perspective interrelation of different dimensions of existing theory to eventually bridge the fields of political and business marketing, identify the underlying causes of voter behaviour, and distil the critical factors of small political parties' (SPPs') strategic marketing communications (MCs) success. The research finally develops a preliminary conceptual strategic MCs model for SPPs that fits the context of developed countries and concentrates on the strategic aspects of MCs. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is largely conceptual and is based on an extensive literature review and secondary data; strengthened through additional and focused quantitative and qualitative data. Findings - The findings indicate an increasing association between business and political marketing, an environmental context that stimulates and nurtures a symbiotic relationship between parties and voters, an enhanced role of ``perception management'', and substantial divergence of SPP reality from classical theory. Research limitations/implications - Further and focused primary research is required towards model testing. Practical implications - A scientific basis is provided for practical strategic implementation of MCs by SPPs. Originality/value - The research value stems from its focus on SPPs, its contribution to the generic discussion on business marketing theory applicability to politics; its reinforcement of existing research on the subject through further data and analyses; and additionally to existing researches' focus, its concentration on the strategic aspects of the subject and its contribution to literature of an analogous strategic political marketing model.},

Some of the psychophysical methods have been applied in a crude way to the measurement of educational products such as handwriting and English composition, and it seems feasible to apply the same ideas as well to social values although the attempt cannot readily be made without making compromises that the psychophysicist would not tolerate. The application of the principles of psychophysical measurement to educational products has been made with more or less similar logical handicaps but these do not seem to have disturbed the popularity of these methods in the field of educational measurement. Since the final results show a rather satisfactory internal consistency, one may possibly assume that the methods, the theoretically imperfect, have some value also in social psychology. For the present experiment the seriousness of different crimes or offenses was chosen for such measurement. The seriousness of an offense we shall assume to be the seriousness as judged rather than as measured in terms of objective consequences or in some normative way. Nineteen offenses were judged: abortion, adultery, arson, assault and battery, bootlegging, burglary, counterfeiting, embezzlement, forgery, homicide, kidnapping, larceny, libel, perjury, rape, receiving stolen goods, seduction, smuggling, and vagrancy. The offenses were arranged in pairs so that every one of them was paired with every other one. The total number of pairs of offenses presented was therefore n(n-1)/2 = 171. College student subjects were presented with the paired offenses and asked to choose which they considered to be the more serious crime. Results show that qualitative judgments of a rather intangible sort, loaded usually with personal opinion, bias, and even strong feeling, and regarded generally as the direct antithesis of quantitative measurement, are nevertheless amenable to the type of quantitative analysis which is associated historically with psychophysics. It is of some interest to see that a set of numerical values can be established by which the 171 observed proportions of judgments about crimes and offenses can be summarized in generalized form.

Researchers using these methods have shown that although survey data reveal unprecedented declines in Americans' expressions of overtly racist attitudes, most Americans continue to harbor an implicit pro-White bias relative to other racial minority groups. This research has generated a great deal of controversy. The primary focus of the controversy has been on the findings that have come out of studies using the Implicit Association Test or IAT -- a response-time computer software program that records the speed with which positive and negative evaluations of different racial groups come to mind. This paper addresses the following questions that continue to divide researchers: (1) What does the IAT measure? (2) How do implicit attitudes as measured by the IAT relate to people's race-related judgments and behaviors? (3) What are the political and legal implications of being able to measure implicit racial bias?},

  abstract = {Background:  The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada has called upon the federal government to provide data on a number of health indicators, including life expectancy among First Nations people, M{\'e}tis and Inuit. In Canada, estimating the life expectancy of Indigenous populations is methodologically challenging since death registrations do not usually collect information on whether the deceased was Indigenous. For the first time in Canada, a series of census-mortality linked datasets has been created that can be used to estimate life expectancies among Indigenous household populations enumerated by a census. Data and methods: Life expectancy is the average number of years a person at a given age would be expected to live if the mortality rates observed for a specific period persisted into the future. For this study, abridged period life tables (based on five-year age groups) were calculated for self-reported First Nations, M{\'e}tis, Inuit and non-Indigenous males and females. Results: Life expectancy was substantially and consistently shorter for First Nations, M{\'e}tis and Inuit household populations compared with the non-Indigenous household population across all time periods. In 2011, life expectancy at age 1 for the male household population was 72.5 years for First Nations, 76.9 years for M{\'e}tis, 70.0 years for Inuit and 81.4 years for non-Indigenous people. Among the female household population, life expectancy at age 1 was 77.7 years for First Nations, 82.3 years for M{\'e}tis, 76.1 years for Inuit and 87.3 for non-Indigenous people. Discussion: With the creation of a series of census-mortality linked datasets, it is now possible to produce national mortality and life expectancy estimates starting at age 1 for Indigenous household populations. The routine monitoring of longevity by population group can inform policy development and planning intended to advance health equity.}

Studies also suggest that there are two distinct facets of pride: authentic and hubristic, associated with distinct forms of self-favorability---self-esteem and narcissism, respectively. Furthermore, each pride facet may function to facilitate the attainment of a distinct form of social rank: prestige versus dominance. We review findings supporting this account, as well as evidence for the prestige and dominance model of social rank, and for a novel account of pride as the critical affective mechanism underlying cumulative cultural evolution.},

What if there is no housing crisis, but instead a housing market working exactly as intended? What if rent hikes and eviction notices aren't the work of the invisible hand of the market, but of a parasitic elite systematically funneling wealth away from working-class families?  With clarity and precision, Tranjan breaks down pervasive myths about renters, mom-and-pop landlords, and housing affordability. In a society where home ownership is seen as the most important hallmark of a successful life, Tranjan refuses to absolve the landlords and governments that reap massive profits from the status quo. The tenant class must face powerful systems of disinformation and exploitation to secure decent homes and fair rent. Drawing upon a long, inspiring history of collective action in Canada, Tranjan argues that organized tenants have the power to fight back.},

Nationally representative Australian survey data show that public trust in university research is higher than that conducted in other institutions. As sources of information, public trust in scientists is considered across potentially polarising and relatively uncontroversial fields of science, with trust varying considerably according to the type of science examined. Public trust is highest in vaccine science and weather forecasting, and lowest for GM crop science, while climate science and forest management fall in between. Social and political background variables are important correlates of trust in science. Younger, tertiary educated, politically progressive Australians are most trusting. Greens party identifiers and environmentalists are more likely than other respondents to trust all types of science examined here---including GM crop science---while institutional trust is positively associated with trust in scientists.},

Over his twenty-five years as a New Democrat MP, Robinson was imprisoned for blocking loggers from clear-cutting in Clayoquot Sound, assaulted by police while protesting at the 2001 Summit of the Americas, expelled from foreign countries for defending human rights, and harassed after coming out as Canada's first openly gay MP. Robinson always took his ideals to the front lines, helping to define the Canadian left. Though his brash tactics dominated headlines, Robinson's full story has not yet been told. In this in-depth biography, Graeme Truelove explores an accomplished life and career, including Robinson's difficult childhood, his growing realization of his own sexuality, and the bipolar diagnosis which followed his baffling, career-ending theft of a diamond ring. A portrait emerges of a complex figure -- driven, gifted, visionary and flawed -- who challenged his country and continues to make his indelible mark on the world.},

  abstract = {This paper explores a judgmental heuristic in which a person evaluates the frequency of classes or the probability of events by availability, i.e., by the ease with which relevant instances come to mind. In general, availability is correlated with ecological frequency, but it is also affected by other factors. Consequently, the reliance on the availability heuristic leads to systematic biases. Such biases are demonstrated in the judged frequency of classes of words, of combinatorial outcomes, and of repeated events. The phenomenon of illusory correlation is explained as an availability bias. The effects of the availability of incidents and scenarios on subjective probability are discussed.},

Reversals of preference are demonstrated in choices regarding monetary outcomes, both hypothetical and real, and in questions pertaining to the loss of human lives. The effects of frames on preferences are compared to the effects of perspectives on perceptual appearance. The dependence of preferences on the formulation of decision problems is a significant concern for the theory of rational choice.}

Adult systemic toxicity at 750 and 7500 ppm in all generations included: reduced body weights and body weight gains, reduced absolute and increased relative weanling and adult organ weights (liver, kidneys, adrenals, spleen, pituitary, and brain), and female slight/mild renal and hepatic pathology at 7500 ppm. Reproductive organ histopathology and function were unaffected. Ovarian weights as well as total pups and live pups/litter on postnatal day (PND) 0 were decreased at 7500 ppm, which exceeded the adult maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Mating, fertility, gestational indices; ovarian primordial follicle counts; estrous cyclicity; precoital interval; gestational length; offspring sex ratios; postnatal survival; nipple/areolae retention in preweanling males; epididymal sperm number, motility, morphology; daily sperm production (DSP), and efficiency of DSP were all unaffected. At 7500 ppm, vaginal patency (VP) and preputial separation (PPS) were delayed in F1, F2, and F3 offspring, associated with reduced body weights. Anogenital distance (AGD) on PND 0 was unaffected for F2 and F3 males and F3 females (F2 female AGD was increased at some doses, not at 7500 ppm, and was considered not biologically or toxicologically relevant). Adult systemic no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) = 75 ppm (5 mg/kg/day); reproductive and postnatal NOAELs = 750 ppm (50 mg/kg/day). There were no treatment-related effects in the low-dose region (0.001-5 mg/kg/day) on any parameters and no evidence of nonmonotonic dose-response curves across generations for either sex. BPA should not be considered a selective reproductive toxicant, based on the results of this study.},

  abstract = {Anonymous student evaluations of teaching (SETs) are used by colleges and universities to measure teaching effectiveness and to make decisions about faculty hiring, firing, re-appointment, promotion, tenure, and merit pay. Although numerous studies have found that SETs correlate with various teaching effectiveness irrelevant factors (TEIFs) such as subject, class size, and grading standards, it has been argued that such correlations are small and do not undermine the validity of SETs as measures of professors' teaching effectiveness. However, previous research has generally used inappropriate parametric statistics and effect sizes to examine and to evaluate the significance of TEIFs on personnel decisions. Accordingly, we examined the influence of quantitative vs. non-quantitative courses on SET ratings and SET based personnel decisions using 14,872 publicly posted class evaluations where each evaluation represents a summary of SET ratings provided by individual students responding in each class. In total, 325,538 individual student evaluations from a US mid-size university contributed to theses class evaluations. The results demonstrate that class subject (math vs. English) is strongly associated with SET ratings, has a substantial impact on professors being labeled satisfactory vs. unsatisfactory and excellent vs. non-excellent, and the impact varies substantially depending on the criteria used to classify professors as satisfactory vs. unsatisfactory. Professors teaching quantitative courses are far more likely not to receive tenure, promotion, and/or merit pay when their performance is evaluated against common standards.},

This bias is argued to serve critical evolutionarily adaptive functions, but its developmental presence and ontogenetic emergence have never seriously been considered. Here, we argue for the existence of the negativity bias in early development, evident especially in research on infant social referencing but also in other developmental domains. We discuss ontogenetic mechanisms underlying the emergence of this bias, and explore not only its evolutionary but also its developmental functions and consequences. Throughout, we suggest ways to further examine the negativity bias in infants and older children, and we make testable predictions that would help clarify the nature of the negativity bias during early development.},

Based on data from a sample of 570 telephone call center representatives, a moderated hierarchical regression analysis revealed that work hours were negatively related to satisfaction with work-family balance, consistent with the resource drain perspective. Job complexity and control over work time were positively associated with satisfaction with work-family balance. Control over work time moderated the relationship such that as work hours rose, workers with low control experienced a decline in work-family balance satisfaction, while workers with high control did not. Results encourage greater research attention to work characteristics, such as job complexity and control over work time, and skills that represent resources useful to the successful integration of work and family demands.

The results are most consistent with a Sociotropic Economic Threat thesis: In all countries, higher-skilled immigrants are preferred to their lower-skilled counterparts at all levels of native socio-economic status (SES). There is little support for the Labor Market Competition hypothesis, since respondents are not more opposed to immigrants in their own SES stratum. While skin tone itself has little effect in any country, immigrants from Muslim-majority countries do elicit significantly lower levels of support, and racial animus remains a powerful force.},

Previous research has shown that the professional roles of individual journalists can influence their behaviour and that occupational socialization leads to similar role conceptions within countries. This article therefore studies the relation between cross-national differences in role conceptions and news content. A survey among political journalists in Denmark, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Spain (N = 425), combined with a content analysis of political coverage in these countries (N = 1,035 newspaper articles) shows that role conceptions vary more across countries than within countries. Spanish political journalists see their role as more sacerdotal and partisan than their colleagues in northern Europe, while British journalists are most entertainment oriented. These differences in role conceptions are reflected in the reporting style of political news.},

Attention should also be paid to the field of study in which people are educated. The authors propose that fields of study supply four types of resources to students: cultural, economic, communicative, and technical. Drawing on data from a nationally representative Dutch survey, they developed scales that measure the prevalence of these four types of resources across 11 fields of study. These scales are related to a wide range of variables in three domains: the labor market, consumption patterns, and sociopolitical orientations. Controlling for level of education, individuals who obtained many cultural resources more often participate in highbrow culture and attain a high cultural occupational status. Individuals who were trained in fields that provide economic resources are more materialistic and conservative in their behavior and attain high economic-status jobs. Those whose field of study attended to communicative qualities are more liberal in their sociopolitical orientation and participate more often in voluntary organizations. Technically educated people tend to have low occupational-status jobs and lifestyle preferences directly associated with their technical skills.]},

That is, possible non-linearities not detected by standard linear models could occur in the relationship between attitudes and behaviour. We present and compare alternative model specifications to assess the non-linear relationship. We test our view using empirical examples relating to the link between environmental concerns and the purchase of organic products, and the link between privacy concerns and the possession of loyalty cards. We find strong support for the appearance of a non-linear relationship between environmental concern and the purchase of organic products, while only weak support for such a relationship between privacy concern and the possession of loyalty cards.},

Combining survey analyses and geocoded polling station data analyses of the 2010 parliamentary elections, it is found that overrepresentation of support in suburban environments cannot be explained by voter composition alone. There is a positive contextual effect in lower-density neighbourhoods in cities and in suburban municipalities, as well as in post-war New Towns. To account for spatial variations, an explanatory framework is proposed based on urban theories of class, revanchism and nostalgia. Traditional middle classes, concentrated in suburbs, seem to support RRPPs to reclaim urban space for daily use and as a defensive strategy in view of metropolitan change.},

Three hypotheses on the nature of country differences in crying were evaluated: (a) distress due to exposure to taxing conditions, (b) norms regarding emotional expressiveness, and (c) personality (at country level). Individuals living in more affluent, democratic, extraverted, and individualistic countries tend to report to cry more often. These indicators relate to freedom of expression rather than to suffering; therefore, our data provide support for a model that views country differences in crying as being connected with country differences in expressiveness and personality rather than in distress. Gender differences in crying proneness were larger in wealthier, more democratic, and feminine countries. Differences in the meaning of crying at individual level (usually viewed as a sign of distress) and country level (as a sign of expressiveness and personality) are discussed.},

Quantitative binding in both matrices increased with higher microsomal protein concentrations (free fractions 0.88-0.32 at 100-500 mu g protein/ml in human liver microsomes and 0.82-0.26 at 250-1000 mu g protein/ml in microsomes from B-lymphoblastoid cells) and was independent of amitriptyline concentration over a concentration range of 0.2 to 200 mu M. Addition of heat-inactivated microsomal protein (50-450 mu g/ml) to native human liver microsomes (50 mu g/ml) reduced the amitriptyline N-demethylation rate in a protein concentration dependent manner. This effect was greater at lower substrate concentrations and was overcome by saturating concentrations of substrate, thereby decreasing the apparent affinities of the high- and low-affinity components of the N-demethylation process, with minimal effect on the net V-max. Addition of metabolically inactive microsomes from untransfected human lymphoblastoid cells (750 mu g/ml) to CYP2C19 (250 mu g/ml protein) increased the apparent K-m value for amitriptyline N-demethylation by 3.5-fold and increased the uncompetitive substrate inhibition constant (K-s) by 2.2-fold, making substrate inhibition essentially undetectable. A similar effect was seen with CYP3A4, with a 1.8-fold increase in the S-50 (substrate concentration at which half-maximal velocity of a Hill enzyme is achieved). Microsomal binding did not alter the V-max of either CYP isoform to any appreciable extent. These findings emphasize the importance of incorporating microsomal binding in the estimation of enzyme kinetic parameters in vitro and making appropriate corrections for unbound drug concentrations.},

We surveyed 468 reporters and editors representing 463 local and national broadcast and print media outlets to characterize individual characteristics and occupational practices leading to the development of health and medical science news. Our survey revealed that 70\% of respondents had bachelor's degrees; 8\% were life sciences majors in college. Minorities are underrepresented in health journalism; 97\% of respondents were non-Hispanic and 93\% were White. Overall, initial ideas for stories come from a ``news source'' followed by press conferences or press releases. Regarding newsworthiness criteria, the ``potential for public impact'' and ``new information or development'' are the major criteria cited, followed by ``ability to provide a human angle'' and ``ability to provide a local angle.'' Significant differences were seen between responses from reporters vs. editors and print vs. broadcast outlets.},

In political contexts, motivated reasoning can help explain a wide range of political phenomena, including extremism, polarization, and misperceptions. However, recent findings in psychology have challenged this account. These perspectives emphasize the role of cognitive sophistication (e.g., analytical reasoning, numerical literacy) in political attitudes, but differ in terms of whether it is expected to attenuate or exacerbate politically motivated reasoning and belief in conspiracy theories. Yet prior investigations have not examined the relative and independent effects of both political and cognitive sophistication. Using data from two samples, including one sampled to approximate representativeness in the U.S., we demonstrate that both types of sophistication have independent and (at times) countervailing effects on belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories and other political attitudes. Our results are critical for theories of cognitive sophistication, political cognition, and attitudes, and the psychology of conspiracy theories.},

  abstract = {The Politics of Precaution examines the politics of consumer and environmental risk regulation in the United States and Europe over the last five decades, explaining why America and Europe have often regulated a wide range of similar risks differently. It finds that between 1960 and 1990, American health, safety, and environmental regulations were more stringent, risk averse, comprehensive, and innovative than those adopted in Europe. But since around 1990, the book shows, global regulatory leadership has shifted to Europe. What explains this striking reversal? David Vogel takes an in-depth, comparative look at European and American policies toward a range of consumer and environmental risks, including vehicle air pollution, ozone depletion, climate change, beef and milk hormones, genetically modified agriculture, antibiotics in animal feed, pesticides, cosmetic safety, and hazardous substances in electronic products. He traces how concerns over such risks--and pressure on political leaders to do something about them--have risen among the European public but declined among Americans. Vogel explores how policymakers in Europe have grown supportive of more stringent regulations while those in the United States have become sharply polarized along partisan lines. And as European policymakers have grown more willing to regulate risks on precautionary grounds, increasingly skeptical American policymakers have called for higher levels of scientific certainty before imposing additional regulatory controls on business.},

  abstract = {Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) are an iconic Arctic species, but residents of Arctic coastal communities are among the few who have opportunities to observe their behavior for extended periods of time. Documenting traditional knowledge about polar bears is thus an important research approach, especially in light of recent rapid changes to summer sea ice extent. We interviewed polar bear hunters in seven Alaska Native communities along the coast of the northern Bering Sea and Chukchi Sea. Our study confirmed findings from similar research conducted in the mid-1990s and added information about the responses of polar bears to more recent environmental change. The distribution and local abundance of polar bears have changed over time, though different communities report different patterns. Polar bears arrive from the north later in fall than previously. Despite substantial changes in sea ice and other aspects of polar bear habitat, the animals generally appear to be in good body condition, and cubs continue to be observed regularly. While polar bears continue to feed primarily on seals, they have been observed eating a diverse range of foods, including eggs, greens, fish, berries, and other foods as available. Reduction in harvest levels due to environmental, economic, and social factors is the overriding trend; however, in years when bears are particularly abundant around villages, this pattern is temporarily reversed. Polar bears remain important spiritually and culturally for the indigenous communities of northern and western Alaska. Les ours polaires (Ursus maritimus) constituent une esp{\`e}ce iconique de l'Arctique, mais les r{\'e}sidents des collectivit{\'e}s c{\^o}ti{\`e}res de l'Arctique figurent parmi les quelques personnes qui ont l'occasion d'observer leur comportement pendant des p{\'e}riodes prolong{\'e}es. C'est pourquoi la consignation des connaissances traditionnelles sur les ours polaires repr{\'e}sente un aspect important de la recherche, surtout {\`a} la lumi{\`e}re des changements rapides caract{\'e}risant l'{\'e}tendue de la glace de mer en {\'e}t{\'e}. Nous avons interview{\'e} des chasseurs d'ours polaires de sept collectivit{\'e}s autochtones de l'Alaska situ{\'e}es le long de la c{\^o}te nord de la mer de B{\'e}ring et de la mer des Tchouktches. Notre {\'e}tude a permis de confirmer les observations {\'e}manant de travaux de recherche similaires r{\'e}alis{\'e}s dans le milieu des ann{\'e}es 1990 ainsi que d'enrichir l'information sur la r{\'e}action des ours polaires vis-{\`a}-vis des changements environnementaux plus r{\'e}cents. La r{\'e}partition et l'abondance locale d'ours polaires ont chang{\'e} au fil du temps, bien que les tendances diff{\`e}rent d'une collectivit{\'e} {\`a} l'autre. {\`A} l'automne, les ours polaires arrivent du Nord plus tard qu'avant. Malgr{\'e} les importants changements qui caract{\'e}risent les glaces de mer et d'autres aspects de l'habitat de l'ours polaire, les animaux semblent g{\'e}n{\'e}ralement en bon {\'e}tat corporel, et l'on continue d'observer des oursons r{\'e}guli{\`e}rement. M{\^e}me si les ours polaires continuent de s'alimenter principalement de phoques, on les a vus en train de manger divers aliments, dont des {\oe}ufs, des plantes vertes, du poisson, des petits fruits et d'autre nourriture, selon les disponibilit{\'e}s. Les taux de r{\'e}colte {\`a} la baisse en raison de facteurs environnementaux, {\'e}conomiques et sociaux constituent la tendance pr{\'e}pond{\'e}rante. Cependant, au cours des ann{\'e}es pendant lesquelles les ours sont nombreux autour des villages, cette tendance est renvers{\'e}e temporairement. Par ailleurs, les ours polaires continuent de rev{\^e}tir une importance spirituelle et culturelle pour les collectivit{\'e}s indig{\`e}nes du nord et de l'ouest de l'Alaska.},

This is comparatively easy to assess in two-party systems, but capturing the pattern of affect towards multiple parties is more complex in multiparty systems. This article first discusses these challenges and then presents different ways of measuring individual-level affective polarization using like-dislike scores, a widespread measure of party sympathy. Using data for 51 countries and 166 elections from five modules of the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems, I then show that affective polarization adds to existing concepts as a way of understanding political participation and democratic orientations. Studying affective polarization outside the US could therefore have important consequences for our understanding of citizen perceptions of politics as well as citizen behaviour, but we need the appropriate measures to do so.},

Although many take media's influence for granted, the evidence points the other way: even for heavy media users, media are probably not a strong causal factor in (especially not personal) risk perception. Risk perception may be affected by the media via availability (more information gives a stronger effect), but the effects are lessened by impersonal impact: general risk perception is more easily changed than personal risk perception. Risk perception is often thought to cause behaviour, but this is still uncertain, and caution is necessary as to this possible connection.},

The communication chaos makes it necessary to revisit normative arguments about journalism and democracy as well as their feasibility in radically new conditions.

  abstract = {Abstract. Despite increasing speculation and attention, as of  yet insufficient empirical research has been conducted on the possibility  of a political cleavage based on differences between Canadian inner cities  and suburbs. This article sheds light on the potential existence of such  differences by analyzing federal elections at the level of the  constituency from 1945 to 1997. Results show that city-suburban  differences in federal party voting did not become significant until the  1980s, and increased after this point, with inner-city residents remaining  to the left of the rest of Canada in their party preferences while  suburbanites shifted increasingly to the right in their voting patterns.  The results obtained from regression analysis suggest that such a  divergence cannot be reduced solely to differences in social composition,  housing tenure, or region, and thus confirm that it constitutes a  `true' political cleavage. It is argued that intra-urban  geography needs to taken into account in future analyses of Canadian  political behaviour.R{\'e}sum{\'e}. Malgr{\'e} un int{\'e}r{\^e}t  croissant pour la question, il existe encore peu de recherches empiriques  sur un possible clivage politique dont les fondements seraient les  diff{\'e}rences entre les quartiers urbains centraux et les banlieues.  Cet article jette un nouvel {\'e}clairage sur l'existence possible  de ces diff{\'e}rences {\`a} partir d'une analyse des  r{\'e}sultats {\'e}lectoraux dans les circonscriptions  f{\'e}d{\'e}rales entre 1945 et 1997. Les r{\'e}sultats obtenus  indiquent que les diff{\'e}rences entre le vote pour les partis  politiques f{\'e}d{\'e}raux ne sont devenues significatives que  pendant les ann{\'e}es 1980, mais qu'elles se sont  exacerb{\'e}es par la suite, les r{\'e}sidents de quartiers centraux  demeurant {\`a} la gauche de l'{\'e}chiquier politique tandis  que les banlieues votaient de plus en plus {\`a} droite.

  abstract = {Vulnerability resulting from debt is part and parcel of the risk society and a salient characteristic of current neoliberal times under financialized global capitalism. Rising indebtedness increases the susceptibility of homeowners to housing and labor market restructuring, and if the degree of leverage is very high, can threaten the solvency, living standards, and social stability of local communities. However, very little is understood regarding how levels of household indebtedness are spatially distributed within or across cities, and how private debt maps onto the geography of race, class, housing, urban form, and other social variables, especially outside of the United States. It remains unknown whether and how higher and unsustainable levels of indebtedness might be associated with urban growth, decline, suburbanization, gentrification, immigration, racialization, and/or greying. This article examines the spatial distribution of household debt in Canadian cities at multiple scales of analysis. It analyzes how levels of household debt relate to a number of key socio-demographic and housing variables from the census, including those related to changes occurring over the 2000s. It simultaneously models the geography of debt at the metropolitan and neighborhood scales using multi-level hierarchical linear modeling methods, and in doing so, it identifies some key drivers and correlates of household debt and the scales at which they operate. The article concludes by discussing the implications of the empirical findings for understanding the role of the emerging urban debtscape in the restructuring of the social geography of the city.},

The election of Ford, and the thrust of his subsequent agenda, came as a surprise to many in the city, due to Toronto's reputation as a cosmopolitan diverse transit-friendly global city. The Toronto case study allows for the analysis of the relationships between Fordism, automobility, and the politics and rationalities of neoliberalism. Instead of seeing neoliberalism as something external or imposed, its contested politics are rooted in diverging social and economic interests directly derived from Fordism and the system of automobility, with opposing political-economic factions both drawing on different elements of neoliberalism. Authoritarian populist neoliberal regimes like the Ford administration in Toronto, and the roll-back austerity they promote, are not antithetical to automobile Fordism, but on the contrary represent an attempt to protect and reinvigorate it in the face of the forces of de-industrialization and financialization. As such they receive their support from social groups irrevocably invested in the continuation, and irrationalities, of the Fordist system of automobility. This has implications for how the politics of neoliberalism might unfold in the future.},

The expressive legacy can be that of a conservator, consolidator, entrepreneur, or catalyst, and the fiduciary legacy is determined by the commission chair's respect for the norms and conventions of commissions of inquiry. Using the case studies from Inwood and Johns' analysis of the commissions' policy legacies, we ascribe expressive and fiduciary legacies to the chairs of the ten commissions. Through analysis of the relationships among the commissions' policy legacies and the chairs' expressive and fiduciary legacies, we explore the ways in which chairs' conduct of the inquiry produce a leadership legacy for the chair.}

Converse suggested, in the early 1960s, that ideology is the province of only a small fraction of the mass public. In part, the rise of ideological voters has been obscured by the tendency of scholars after Converse to equate them with those who use terms referring to ideological concepts, such as liberal and conservative, in open-ended interviews. These ``concept ideologues,'' however, are not the only members of the public whose political opinions show evidence of ideological constraint. There is also a growing segment of the public, the ``policy ideologues,'' who take positions on three or more policy issues but do not happen to mention ideological concepts. Policy ideologues prove to be as politically knowledgeable as concept ideologues; their attitudes are nearly as constrained across issues and over time; and their policy stances usually ``make sense'' as liberal or conservative---not surprisingly, as they are almost as willing as concept ideologues to label themselves ideologically, when asked. By 2012, the portion of the public consisting of concept and policy ideologues had reached 42 percent. It declined to 38 percent in 2016, but was still a far cry from the 12 percent of the electorate whom Converse identified as ideologues or near ideologues as of 1956.},

This reverses the usual causal order, in which it is assumed that people start with values, add what little factual information they have, and produce policy, partisan, or ideological ``attitudes'' as a result. If people actually work backwards from their political behavior to their attitudes, and from their attitudes to their beliefs about ``the facts,'' there are obvious and troubling implications for democratic legitimacy, as well as for the academic study of democratic competence. I confine myself here to exploring some of the empirical evidence for rationalization, and to thinking about how to solve the resulting research problems, bracketing the normative issues.},

  abstract = {Many scholars have lamented the regulation of electronic media as an encroachment on the First Amendment guarantee of press freedom. They argue that the licensing process creates the possibility and means for politicians to meddle with broadcasters' content decisions, and they cite a long history of political interference to support their claims. From this literature, the authors define three specific hypotheses concerning the chilling effect of broadcast regulation: (1) news organizations with broadcast holdings will present more positive coverage of elected officials, (2) news organizations with broadcast holdings will present a narrower range of editorial positions, and (3) these effects will be magnified when political control of the presidency and Congress is united under a single party. These hypotheses are subjected to a rigorous empirical test based on 469 newspaper editorials commenting on presidential State of the Union addresses between 1970 and 1995. The authors predict the expected editorial stance of newspapers as a function of environmental and internal factors and define editorial bias as the difference between their expected and observed editorial stances. Based on these data, support is found for the chilling hypothesis. Newspapers with broadcast holdings systematically write editorials that are more positive, and the difference is statistically significant. They also tend to offer a narrower range of editorial positions, although this difference does not attain standard levels of statistical significance. These effects, however, do not appear to be magnified by unified party control of the executive and legislative branches.},

This study follows up on previous research examining media portrayals of climate change in US newspapers from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2008. Here, we content analyze 270 news stories on climate change as a public health issue from five US newspapers between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2012. Findings indicate that the total number of articles about climate change declined while emphasis on the public health dimension of climate change increased. The types of generic news frames (i.e., dramatic/substantive) most frequently used did not considerably change across the two time periods, however. To explain this, we discuss ways in which people may assess and spark change in news framing of public issues to better reach and influence a range of audiences.},

  abstract = {Max Weber's Economy and Society is the greatest sociological treatise written in this century. Published posthumously in Germany in the early 1920's, it has become a constitutive part of the modern sociological imagination. Economy and Society was the first strictly empirical comparison of social structures and normative orders in world-historical depth, containing the famous chapters on social action, religion, law, bureaucracy, charisma, the city, and the political community with its dimensions of class, status and power. Economy and Status is Weber's only major treatise for an educated general public. It was meant to be a broad introduction, but in its own way it is the most demanding textbook yet written by a sociologist. The precision of its definitions, the complexity of its typologies and the wealth of its historical content make the work a continuos challenge at several levels of comprehension: for the advanced undergraduate who gropes for his sense of society, for the graduate student who must develop his own analytical skills, and for the scholar who must match wits with Weber. When the long-awaited first complete English edition of Economy and Society was published in 1968, Arthur Stinchcombe wrote in the American Journal of Sociology: "My answer to the question of whether people should still start their sociological intellectual biographies with Economy and Society is yes." Reinhard Bendix noted in the American Sociological Review that the "publication of a compete English edition of Weber's most systematic work [represents] the culmination of a cultural transmission to the American setting...It will be a study-guide and compendium for years to come for all those interested in historical sociology and comparative study." In a lengthy introduction, Guenther Roth traces the intellectual prehistory of Economy and Society, the gradual emergence of its dominant themes and the nature of its internal logic. Mr. Roth is a Professor of Sociology at Columbia University. Mr. Wittich heads an economic research group at the United Nations.},

We show that these conventional approaches understate the total effects of the site of production by failing to capitalize on the institutionalized social categories that develop at the detailed occupational level.},

In this paper, I argue that one way of getting undergraduate students involved in political science research is to develop undergraduate research labs, wherein a small group of undergraduate students works collaboratively with a faculty member to carry out the research process from start to finish. I focus on how to develop and operate research labs at small to mid-sized institutions. I provide an overview of how I organized and conducted an undergraduate research lab and illustrate how the lab worked by describing a project that my lab recently carried out. I also describe how political science research labs can benefit students and political science programs. I end by reflecting on what I learned along the way, which I hope will be helpful to others who are considering developing similar experiences. Overall, I encourage other political scientists to develop undergraduate research labs but argue that, given the high teaching loads at many institutions, faculty should operate research labs as classes so that they count as part of one's teaching load.},

In this teacher's corner, we address these barriers by providing an overview of general steps and operations in a computational text analysis project, and demonstrate how each step can be performed using the R statistical software. As a popular open-source platform, R has an extensive user community that develops and maintains a wide range of text analysis packages.

If women are to truly participate in the decision of whether or not to be screened, they need some quantification of its benefits and harms. Providing such information is a challenging task, however, given the uncertainty---and underlying professional disagreement---about the data. In this article, we attempt to bound this uncertainty by providing a range of estimates---optimistic and pessimistic---on the absolute frequency of 3 outcomes important to the mammography decision: breast cancer deaths avoided, false alarms, and overdiagnosis. Among 1000 US women aged 50 years who are screened annually for a decade, 0.3 to 3.2 will avoid a breast cancer death, 490 to 670 will have at least 1 false alarm, and 3 to 14 will be overdiagnosed and treated needlessly. We hope that these ranges help women to make a decision: either to feel comfortable about their decision to pursue screening or to feel equally comfortable about their decision not to pursue screening. For the remainder, we hope it helps start a conversation about where additional precision is most needed.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

We do so with multilevel modelling taking advantage of high-quality cross-national European data. First, we focus on social cleavages related to voting, e.g. social class and religiosity. Second, we examine the effects of several contextual characteristics, of which some are classical and others new. Third, we take diverse socio-political attitudes into account. We test whether euro-scepticism affects voting for the radical right, over and beyond other determinants that have previously been proposed to determine radical right-wing voting. We find evidence that euro-scepticism indeed contributes to the explanation of voting for the radical right beyond perceived ethnic threat and political distrust. At the same time euro-scepticism is much less relevant than perceived ethnic threat in explaining why particular social categories, i.e. lower educated people, manual workers, unemployed people and non-churchgoers are more likely to vote for the radical right.},

Software tracked selective exposure in seconds, and attitudes were measured before, immediately after, and two days after message exposure. Further, information processing styles were assessed. The confirmation bias emerged regardless of source quality. Information processing styles moderated the confirmation bias as well as selective exposure to messages from unbiased vs. slanted sources.

This essay focuses on Cyrus's twofold Persian education, which consisted of his conventional and heterodox educations. The former emphasized the rule of law, while the latter stressed the need for absolute rule by a single leader. In order to evaluate Cyrus's revolution, one must grasp the relative strengths and weaknesses of the Persian regime that educated him, especially in light of the impressive but short-lived empire he founded. In the end, the "Cyropaedia" unfolds as a deeply ironic work. Despite Cyrus's prodigious wisdom, the empire he founded was for Xenophon neither unequivocally lasting nor good. In this sense, Xenophon's own knowledge rivals and supercedes that of Cyrus, insofar as Xenophon realized that wisdom is no match for the chaotic world of politics, a sobering and realistic outlook still applicable today.},

I situate within this broad theoretical framework the theories of Habermas and Dewey. In the process, I argue (a) that while Dewey largely failed to reconcile his democratic ideal with the empirical constraint of large-scale organizations, Habermas, in particular his work on the public sphere, provides an important starting point for considering the state of public participation within the communication distortions of advanced capitalism; (b) that to fully understand the relation between communication distortions and public participation, social theorists must look beyond Habermas and return to Dewey to mobilize his bi-level view of habitual and reflective human agency; and, finally, (c) that the perspective of a Deweyan political theory of reflective agency best furthers our understanding of potential communication distortions and public participation, particularly in the empirical spaces of media centralization and intellectual property rights.},

Graham White renders a clear account of the development, structure, and operation of cabinet and the role of first ministers at the federal, provincial, and territorial levels. He discusses how the processes that support cabinet are affected by the considerable power of the first minister, and looks at the ways in which they permit the involvement of other elected members and the public. Taking the view that characterizing our Westminster-style government is an oversimplification, White examines first ministers and cabinets in terms of accountability and transparency and proposes realistic improvements to this aspect of Canadian democracy.},

  abstract = {Densifying existing settlements is a top planning priority worldwide. Its main goals include protecting undeveloped land, reducing CO2 emissions, and the provision of housing. Despite a common acceptance of densification as a planning strategy, the local implementation of densification tends to provoke local opposition. Based on the analysis of a survey on densification preferences (including an adaptive conjoint experiment), this paper examines how residents assess potential densification projects in the Canton of Zurich in Switzerland. The results indicate that residents tend to accept densification in general, but not in their own neighbourhood. Residents in urban neighbourhoods are more likely to accept densification, and if they resist it, they tend to be driven by NIMBY behaviour. The higher likelihood of resistance to densification in suburban and rural contexts seems to be based on either broader anti-growth sentiments or on NIMBY behaviour. Different project characteristics (project-related factors) can explain residents' acceptance of and resistance to densification projects, yet the neighbourhood types in which residents live moderate the impact of these project-related factors. Our findings distinguish between the preferences of residents who live in different residential neighbourhood types and can thus provide planners with a starting point from which to craft context-dependent densification projects tailored to these different neighbourhood types.},

The online version of this article has been corrected.] Psychology is in a replication crisis that has brought about a period of self-reflection and reform. Yet, this reform appears in many ways to focus primarily on methodological and statistical practices, with little consideration for the foundational issues that concern many theoretical and philosophical psychologists and that may provide a richer account of the crisis. In this article, we offer an overview of the history of the replication crisis, the critiques and reforms at the heart of the crisis, and several points of intersection between the reform movement and broader theoretical and philosophical issues. We argue that the problems of the replication crisis and the concerns of the reform movement in fact provide various points of entry for theoretical and philosophical psychologists to collaborate with reformers in providing a more deeply philosophical critique and reform.

Using standard text scaling techniques, we analyze partisanship in a novel dataset of more than 300,000 news articles produced by 644 journalists at 25 different US news outlets. We then develop a novel, semi-supervised model of partisanship of Twitter following relationships and show a modest correlation between the partisanship of whom a journalist follows on Twitter and the content she produces. The findings provide insight into the partisan dynamics that appear to characterize the US media ecosystem in its broad contours, dynamics that may be traceable from social media networks to published stories.},

Assessing the training needs of these professionals is an important step toward providing appropriate training programs in chronic disease prevention and control competencies. Objectives Conduct a survey of the chronic disease workforce in state and local health departments to identify professional training needs. Design We conducted a cross sectional survey of state, territorial and local public health professionals who work in chronic disease programs, to identify their self-reported training needs, using the membership lists of three professional organizations that included practitioners in chronic disease public health programs. Setting The survey was national, used a convenience sample and was conducted in 2011. Participants The survey was developed using an algorithm to select anonymous participants from the membership lists of the NACDD, the Directors for Health Promotion and Education (DHPE), and the National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO). Outcome measures The survey included questions about professional background, chronic disease activities, confidence about skills, and needs for training. Results The survey had 567 responses (38\% response ratio). The majority of the respondents were female, non-Hispanic white, and aged 40 years or older. Respondents were not confident of their skills in health economics (38\%) and technology and data management (23\%). The most requested training topics were assessing the effects of policies, laws, and regulations (70\%); and health economics (66\%). Conclusions This survey included local, territorial, and state public health professionals who work in chronic disease programs. These reported training needs in quantitative measurement methods and policy-related topics suggest key subjects for future training and education curricula.},

Analysts of American politics distinguish liberals from conservatives and Democrats from Republicans, but do not explain how these categories of political allegiance develop, maintain themselves, or change. Wildavsky offers a cultural-functional explanation for ideological and partisan coherence and realignment. Wildavsky also felt that these dualisms did not adequately capture the ideological and partisan variation he observed on the political landscape. Like others, he detected another recurring strain of political allegiance: that of classical liberalism or libertarianism. People of this political stripe valued freedom more than equality (the primary political value of contemporary liberals), and also more than order, the primary political value of conservatives.},

Someone sounded the alarm, someone else said we were safe, and both had science on their side. Whom are we to trust? How are we to know? Amid this chaos of questions and conflicting information, Aaron Wildavsky arrives with just what the beleaguered citizen needs: a clear, fair, and factual look at how the rival claims of environmentalists and industrialists work, what they mean, and where to start sorting them out. Working with his students at a risk analysis center, Wildavsky examined all the evidence behind the charges and countercharges in several controversial cases involving environmental health and public safety. Here he lays out these cases in terms an average citizen can understand, weighs the merits of the claims of various parties, and offers reasoned judgments on the government's response. From Love Canal to Times Beach, from DDT to Agent Orange, acid rain, and global warming, from saccharin to asbestos, nuclear waste, and radon, Wildavsky shows how we can achieve an informed understanding of the contentious environmental issues that confront us daily. The book supports the conclusion Wildavsky reached himself, both as a citizen committed to the welfare of the earth and its inhabitants, and as a social scientist concerned with how public policy is made: though it is bad to be harmed, it is worse to be harmed in the name of health.},

Results indicate that as key election events drew near, candidates increased the number of e-mail messages they sent.

The study also investigated issue coverage, message strategy, and interactivity. The findings indicate that e-mail messages are potent instruments because they can be forwarded to myriad nonsubscribers.

  abstract = {This paper uses data from a 1977 survey of 600 senior decision-makers in Canadian government, business, and labour to investigate the relationship between the social background characteristics of elites and their responses to social policy issues. It argues that in spite of the common assumption that decision makers will systematically favour the interests of the social classes from which they emerge, elite policy positions are primarily a function of the values and interests they represent as elites. Although the analysis confirms a bias in the membership of Canadian elites favouring dominant social groups and classes, this bias largely fails to account for the contours of elite debate over policies of welfare state retrenchment. The paper concludes that elite politics should not be conceived primarily as a function of the personal characteristics of decision makers and therefore, that substituting individuals with different social backgrounds within existing institutional arrangements and power relationships should not be expected to substantially change the nature of elite politics in Canada. /// Cet article se base sur les donn{\'e}es d'un sondage de 1977 aupr{\`e}s de 600 d{\'e}cideurs canadiens des gouvernements, des affaires et du travail. Il {\'e}tudie la relation entre les caract{\'e}ristiques de leur milieu social d'origine et leurs politiques sociales. On constate {\`a} l'encontre de l'hypoth{\`e}se connue selon laquelle les d{\'e}cideurs favorisent syst{\'e}matiquement leurs classes sociales d'origine, que leurs positions politiques sont surtout fonction des valeurs et des int{\'e}r{\^e}ts qu'ils repr{\'e}sentent comme {\'e}lites. Malgr{\'e} que l'analyse constate un penchant parmi ces {\'e}lites qui favorise les groupes et les classes de la soci{\'e}t{\'e} qui dominent, ce penchant n'explique pas la dynamique du d{\'e}bat de ces {\'e}lites ou sujet des politiques sur la r{\'e}duction des programmes sociaux de l'Etat providence. L'article conclue que les politiques des {\'e}lites ne sont pas premi{\`e}rement fonction des caract{\'e}ristiques personelles des d{\'e}cideurs et que de subtituer des individus de diff{\'e}rents milieux sociaux dans le cadre des arrangements des institutions et des rapports de force qui existent ne devrait pas changer substantiellement les politiques des {\'e}lites au Canada.},

It explores how the government employed a number of political strategies in an effort to limit potential opposition to its retrenchment policies. The article argues the government was able to achieve its goals because it controlled the debate on the cause and potential consequences of deficit spending and government debt. This allowed the government to define problems and issues in terms that most suited its goal of restructuring the provincial welfare state. The conclusion notes that the Alberta experience offers an opportunity to add to the limited but growing literature on subnational social policy retrenchment.},

The current woes facing some media primarily reflect a short-term, cyclical decline in advertising revenue caused by the economic downturn, the accumulated results of media consolidation, and the financialization of the media. The latter process saw vast sums of capital investment in the creation of massive media conglomerates based on wildly optimistic projections where future profits would grow faster than the expanding network media economy and exceed the high profits that characterized the media in the past. When that rosy scenario failed to materialize, some media companies were indeed in trouble and saddled with unsustainable debts, but there has been no crisis of the media per se. R{\'E}SUM{\'E} ~ Les nouveaux m{\'e}dias ont agrandi l'{\'e}conomie des m{\'e}dias sans cannibaliser les bases {\'e}conomiques des m{\'e}dias traditionnels. Les probl{\`e}mes actuels que confrontent certains de ces m{\'e}dias refl{\`e}tent surtout un d{\'e}clin {\`a} court terme des revenus publicitaires caus{\'e} par la situation {\'e}conomique r{\'e}cente, les r{\'e}sultats cumulatifs de la fusion des m{\'e}dias, et la financialisation des m{\'e}dias.

  abstract = {When economists wrestle with issues such as unemployment, inflation, or budget deficits, they do so by incorporating an impersonal, detached mode of reasoning. But economists also analyze issues that, to others, typically do not fall within the realm of economic reasoning, such as organ transplants, cigarette addiction, overeating, and product safety. Trade-Offs is an introduction to the economic approach to analyzing these controversial public policy issues.~Harold Winter provides readers with the analytical tools needed to identify and understand the trade-offs associated with these topics. By considering both the costs and benefits of potential policy solutions, Winter stresses that real-world decision making is best served by an explicit recognition of as many trade-offs as possible. This new edition incorporates recent developments in policy debates, including the rise of ``new paternalism,'' or policies designed to protect people from themselves; alternative ways to increase the supply of organs available for transplant; and economic approaches to controlling infectious disease.~Intellectually stimulating yet accessible and entertaining, Trade-Offs will be appreciated by students of economics, public policy, health administration, political science, and law, as well as by anyone who follows current social policy debates.},

In prior accounts, evaluations of the election depend on people's candidate preferences, where supporters of the winning candidate tend to call the election fair while those on the losing side feel it was unfair. I argue that perceptions of election fairness reflect not just the election outcome, but also the campaign process. Using a set of multilevel models and data from the 1996--2004 American National Election Studies, I explore the consequences of campaign experiences in shaping people's evaluations of the fairness of a presidential election. I find that as campaign competition increases, people are less likely to translate their feelings about the candidates into their evaluations of the election. Rather than alienating citizens, competitive campaigns mitigate the effects of prior preferences in a way that promotes the legitimacy of elections.},

If Kirchheimer's assertions about the emergence and success of catch-all parties are correct, we should discover decreased fragmentation in Western European party systems. However, there is little evidence for this. In recent years many party systems have become more, rather than less, fragmented. Catch-all parties have succeeded only in countries which experienced crises and disruptions in development. Elsewhere the strength of partisan attachments prevent the success of catch-all parties. Increased fragmentation in the 1970s reflects the weakening of partisan attachments, the emergence of new concerns, and growing reactions against goverment policies and practices. Minor parties have gained support because they were better able to mobilise discontent and fulfil the expressive functions of political parties.},

Yet despite the formal recognition accorded to Aboriginal and treaty rights, Indigenous peoples continue to argue they are still being colonized. Grace Woo assesses this allegation using a binary model that distinguishes colonial from postcolonial legality. She argues that two legal paradigms governed the expansion of the British Empire, one based on popular consent, the other on conquest and the power to command. Despite the best intentions of lawyers and judges, the beliefs and practices of the colonial age continue to haunt Supreme Court of Canada rulings concerning Indigenous rights. The binary analysis applied in Ghost Dancing with Colonialism casts explanatory light on ongoing tensions between Canada and Indigenous peoples, suggesting new ways to bridge the cultural divide and arrive at a truly postcolonial justice system.

Overall, respondents preferred to define open government in terms of access to information and sources. However, controlling for age, ideology and language, we also found that respondents in the different positions ranked definitions of open government differently. Journalists are more likely than any other group to define open government in terms of access to information and sources. In contrast, parliamentarians who were members of a governing party were as likely to choose definitions of open government that emphasized public participation as they were to choose definitions that emphasized access to information. Opposition parliamentarians share more similarities with government parliamentarians than with journalists. These results suggest that key actors in the Canadian policy landscape define open government in ways that are consistent with their institutional interests. We suggest that these results reflect ways in which open government operates more like a buzzword, which helps explain the common pattern whereby opposition parties make promises to be more open and, after taking power, operate in less open ways. Moreover, these results raise questions about the extent to which open government can actually operate as an organizing principle.},

Theoretically, this commentary describes why scientists in academia's current incentive system work against their self-interest if they prioritize research credibility. Empirically, a comprehensive review of meta-scientific research with a focus on quantitative political science demonstrates that threats to the credibility of political science findings are systematic and real. Yet, the review also shows the discipline's recent progress toward more credible research. The commentary proposes specific institutional changes to better align individual researcher rationality with the collective good of verifiable, robust, and valid scientific results. Angesichts der ,,Glaubw{\"u}rdigkeitsrevolutionen`` in anderen Sozialwissenschaften liegen Fragen nach der Verl{\"a}sslichkeit institutioneller Wissensproduktion auch in der Politikwissenschaft nahe.

A mandate is not the same as a mere recommendation or the standard of practice. At minimum, a mandate should require an active opt-out and there should be some penalty for refusing to abide by it. Over-loose use of the term 'mandate' and the easing of opt-out provisions could eventually pose a risk to the gains that truly mandatory public health interventions, such as childhood vaccines, have provided over the last 50 years. Already, confusion about what counts as a mandate, and about what criteria should be used to determine when a public health intervention should be implemented as a mandate, has led to some inappropriate public policy decisions. For instance, by any reasonable criteria, the yearly influenza vaccine should be mandatory for health care workers. To enforce this mandate, those who refuse vaccination should be required to sign a waiver, and patients - especially those at high risk from flu - should be informed when they receive care from unvaccinated practitioners.},

Aboriginal traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) on subpopulation trend agreed with the seven stable/increasing results and one of the declining results, but disagreed with PVA status of five other declining subpopulations. The decline in the Baffin Bay subpopulation appeared to be due to over-reporting of harvested numbers from outside Canada. The remaining four disputed subpopulations (Southern Beaufort Sea, Northern Beaufort Sea, Southern Hudson Bay, and Western Hudson Bay) were all incompletely mark--recapture (M-R) sampled, which may have biased their survival and subpopulation estimates. Three of the four incompletely sampled subpopulations were PVA identified as nonviable (i.e., declining even with zero harvest mortality). TEK disagreement was nonrandom with respect to M-R sampling protocols. Cluster analysis also grouped subpopulations with ambiguous demographic and harvest rate estimates separately from those with apparently reliable demographic estimates based on PVA probability of decline and unharvested subpopulation growth rate criteria. We suggest that the correspondence between TEK and scientific results can be used to improve the reliability of information on natural systems and thus improve resource management. Considering both TEK and scientific information, we suggest that the current status of Canadian polar bear subpopulations in 2013 was 12 stable/increasing and one declining (Kane Basin). We do not find support for the perspective that polar bears within or shared with Canada are currently in any sort of climate crisis. We suggest that monitoring the impacts of climate change (including sea ice decline) on polar bear subpopulations should be continued and enhanced and that adaptive management practices are warranted.},

  abstract = {Although they are sometimes confused, in theory government and political advertising are separate and quite distinct. By convention, government advertising - paid for directly by taxpayers - is to be used only for necessary government information campaigns which are neutral in nature and not liable to be perceived as creating a partisan benefit for the ruling party. By contrast, political advertising occurs predominantly during elections, is paid for by political parties or candidates, and is necessarily partisan, persuasive and usually highly emotive in nature. However, in the past two decades these distinctions have broken down. This paper explores the growing links between the two types of advertising at the federal level and concludes that there is a vast gap between the theory and reality of government advertising.},

Variation over time in the relative intensity of the opposing communications, along with citizen differences in attention to politics and in political values, interact in the model to explain both cross-sectional patterns of mass opinion and opinion change across surveys.

What it shows is not just the power of a booming economy to buttress presidential popularity. It shows, more generally, the importance of political substance, as against media hype, in American politics. Even when, as occurred in this case, public opinion is initially responsive to media reports of scandal, the public's concern with actual political achievement reasserts itself. This lesson, which was not nearly so clear before the Lewinsky matter as it is now, not only deepens our understanding of American politics. It also tends, as I argue in the second half of this article, to undermine the importance of one large branch of public opinion research, buttress the importance of another, and point toward some new research questions.Whatever else may have transpired by the time this article gets into print, the Lewinsky poll bounce is something worth pondering. In a half-dozen commercial polls taken in the period just before the story broke, Clinton's job approval rating averaged about 60\%. Ten days later, following intensive coverage of the story and Clinton's State of the Union address, presidential support was about 10 percentage points higher.},

The model abandons the conventional but implausible notion that most people possess opinions at the level of specificity of typical survey items--and instead assumes that most people are internally conflicted over most political issues--and that most respond to survey questions on the basis of whatever ideas are at the top of their heads at the moment of answering. Numerous empirical regularities are shown to be consistent with these assumptions.},

Moreover, there are major problems in the book's Parable of Purple Land. What, then, becomes of the top-down view of elite-mass interaction outlined in Nature and Origins? To answer this question, I begin by characterizing the kinds of opinions Nature and Origins leaves out: Converse's ``group interest'' voters, ``nature of the times'' voters, and issue publics. I then add a model of political parties as policy-motivated organizers of Converse's voter types. The upshot is an account of elite/mass interactions that is still largely top-down and that has roles for both the elite-led attitudes that the RAS model explains and the less conventional and harder-to-shape attitudes that it overlooks.},

  abstract = {Web surveys can be programmed to capture a variety of paradata regarding how respondents answer questions. These paradata provide great opportunities for researchers to assess response quality, specifically whether respondents engage in satisficing -- not spending enough effort to provide accurate responses. In particular, speeding (i.e., giving answers very quickly) has increasingly been used as an indicator for satisficing and low response quality. However, few studies have examined whether speeding actually leads to compromised response quality. To address this gap in the literature, the current study investigates speeding behaviors among Web respondents from a probability-based panel. We first identify and characterize respondents who speed more frequently than others over the entire questionnaire. To explore the impact of speeding on response quality, we then examine whether respondents who speed more frequently also straightline in more grid questions. The results show that the tendency to speed is related to several respondent characteristics, particularly age (younger respondents are more likely to speed). This study also reveals that more speeding seems to be universally related to more straightlining, and this relationship is particularly strong among the less educated respondents.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Bisphenol A (BPA) exposure may promote obesity, but its effect on bone mineral density (BMD) has not been reported in humans. We aimed to examine the relationships between BPA exposure, body composition, serum estradiol, leptin, osteocalcin levels and BMDs in healthy premenopausal women. DESIGN AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, a total of 246 healthy premenopausal women aged 20years and older with regular menstrual cycles were investigated. Body mass index (BMI), fat mass, fat-free mass and BMDs were measured by DXA. Serum estradiol, leptin, osteocalcin, urinary BPA and NTx levels were also tested. RESULTS: Urinary BPA levels were positively associated with fat mass (r=0.193, p=0.006) and leptin (r=0.236, p=0.001) but not with fat-free mass after adjusting for age and BMI. BPA was not associated with serum estradiol levels, BMDs, or bone resorption marker NTx and bone formation parameter osteocalcin, either. A multivariate stepwise regression analysis confirmed that serum leptin levels were positively influenced by fat mass ({$\beta$}=0.746, p{$<$}0.001) and BPA ({$\beta$}=0.127, p=0.01) but negatively correlated with fat-free mass ({$\beta$}=-0.196, p{$<$}0.001). However, the changes of BMDs at the lumbar spine ({$\beta$}=0.298, p{$<$}0.001) and femoral neck ({$\beta$}=0.305, p{$<$}0.001) were primarily explained by fat-free mass, and were irrelevant of the fat mass, leptin or BPA exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Although BPA exposure is related with increased amount of fat mass and elevated serum leptin levels, it has neutral effect on BMDs in premenopausal women, possibly due to the exclusive role of fat-free mass, which is unrelated to BPA in determining BMDs.

While scholars recognize both as important, there is a longstanding debate about how these dispositions influence each other. One camp argues that partisanship shapes policy attitudes much more strongly than the reverse, the other claims policy attitudes exert a powerful influence on partisanship. In this paper, I take up this debate and test these claims. I assess whether individuals bring their partisanship in line with their policy orientations with an analysis of 14 ANES and GSS panels. The highly educated have more stable attitudes and are more likely to bring their partisanship and policy attitudes in line with each other. The relationship is weaker among those with only a high school diploma. These results show that policy attitudes exert an underappreciated influence on partisanship. Overall, I find the policy orientations shape partisanship at least as much as the reverse.},
